  <h2 class='c007'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>When</span> I wrote <i>Who’s Who</i>, sixteen or seventeen years ago,
I used to receive shoals of funny letters from people who
wanted, or did not want, to be included, and now, when I
have not edited the book for more than a dozen years, I still
receive letters of criticism on the way in which I conduct it,
and usually consign them to limbo. A few months ago,
however, I received the subjoined letter, which is so out of
the ordinary that I quote it to show what illustrious correspondents
I have. I must not attach the author’s name,
though every grown-up man in the civilised world would be
interested to know it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p class='c010'>“Kindly cease to omit my name from your ever-increasing
list of persons as annually placed before the
public for sale at any price it is worth. Just put me down
in place of Victoria Alice, who is an American pure and
simple, while I am left out in the cold. I am the daughter of
King Edward VII....<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c011'><sup>[1]</sup></a> I am the legal spouse of
Nicholas II, Czar of Russia, being legally married to him
in 1890, Aug. 14, a ratification of which occurrence was held
by me in hallway of British Embassy, Paris, France, 1900,
same date. Just give me a notice, will you, instead of harping
on the sisterhood of King George V, who form among themselves
a similar affair to that held by female contingent of
Synagogue, doing more damage in the community, and
eventually in the world, than any one set of people anywhere,
with method so secret that even Rabbi is unable to uncover
the original design known as main point in England.</p>
<div class='c012'>“Sincerely,</div>
<div class='c012'>“Etc., etc.</div>
<p class='c013'>“<i>October 23, 1913.</i>”</p>

<div class='footnote c014' id='f1'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This portion of the letter could not be printed.</p>
</div>

<p class='c016'>If I could tell all I know about the interesting people I
have met, the book would read like my own <i>Who’s Who</i>
re-written by Walter Emanuel for publication in <i>Punch</i>. As
it is, the book contains a great deal of information about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>celebrities which could never appear in <i>Who’s Who</i>, and all
the best anecdotes which I remember about my friends,
except those which would turn my friends into enemies, and
even some of those I mean to give in this preface, minus the
names, to prevent their being lost to posterity.</p>

<p class='c016'>The twenty years of my life which I here present to readers
are the twenty years which I spent at 32, Addison Mansions,
Kensington, during which I was in constant intercourse with
most of the best-known writers of the generation. The book
is therefore largely taken up with personal reminiscences and
impressions of them—indeed, not a few of them, such as
Conan Doyle, J. K. Jerome, I. Zangwill, H. A. Vachell, Charles
Garvice, Eden Phillpotts, Mr. and Mrs. C. N. Williamson, Mrs.
Croker, Mrs. Perrin, Madame Albanesi, Compton Mackenzie,
and Jeffery Farnol’s mentor, wrote specially for this book
an account of the circumstances which led to their being
authors. For it must be remembered that the majority of
authors start life in some other profession, and drift into
authorship as they discover their aptitude for it. Conan
Doyle was a doctor, in busy practice when he wrote <i>The
White Company</i>; Jerome was a lawyer’s clerk when he
wrote <i>Three Men in a Boat</i>; both Hardy and Hall Caine began
as architects; Zangwill was a teacher, and W. W. Jacobs was
a clerk in the General Post Office.</p>

<p class='c016'>An index of the authors of whom personal reminiscences
are told in this book will be found at the end.</p>

<p class='c016'>Its earlier chapters deal with my life prior to our going to
Addison Mansions, giving details of my parentage and bringing-up,
of the seven years I spent in Australia and the United
States, and my long visits to Canada and Japan. From that
point forward, except for the four chapters which deal with
the writing of my books, the present volume is occupied
chiefly with London literary society from 1891 to 1911.</p>

<p class='c016'>It was in the ’nineties that the late Sir Walter Besant’s
efforts to bring authors together by the creation of the
Authors’ Club, and their trade union, the Authors’ Society,
bore fruit. English writers, who had hitherto been the
reverse of gregarious, began to meet each other very often
at receptions and clubs.</p>

<p class='c016'>In those days one made new friends among well-known
authors, artists, and theatrical people every day, at places
like the Authors’, Arts, Vagabonds, Savage, Hogarth and
Argonauts’ Clubs, the Idler teas, and women’s teas at the
Pioneer Club, the Writers’ Club, and the Women Journalists’,
and various receptions in Bohemia. It was almost an offence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>to spend an entire afternoon, or an entire evening, in any other
way, and though it made inroads on one’s time for work, and
time for exercise, it gave one an intimacy, which has lasted,
with men and women who have since risen to the head of
their professions. That intimacy is reflected in these pages,
which show a good deal of the personal side of the literary
movement of the ’nineties and the literary club life of the
period.</p>

<p class='c016'>I have endeavoured in this book to interest my readers in
two ways—by telling them the circumstances in my bringing-up,
and my subsequent life, which made me a busy man of
letters instead of a lawyer, and by giving them my reminiscences
of friends who have won the affection of the public
in literature, in art, and on the stage.</p>

<p class='c016'>As I feel that a great many of my readers will be much
more interested in my reminiscences than in my life, I advise
them to begin at Chapter VI—or, better still, Chapter VIII—from
which point forward, with the exceptions of Chapters
XVI-XIX, the book is taken up more with the friends I have
had the good fortune to know than with myself.</p>

<p class='c016'>Before concluding, I will give three or four stories too
personal to have names attached to them.</p>

<p class='c016'>I once heard a Bishop, who in those days was a smug and
an Oxford Don, remark to a circle of delighted undergraduates,
“My brother Edward thinks I’m an awful fool.” As his
brother Edward was Captain of the Eton Eleven, and
amateur champion of something or other, there is no doubt
that his brother Edward did think him an awful fool.</p>

<p class='c016'>I once heard an author, at the very moment that Robert
Louis Stevenson, as we had learnt by telegram that afternoon,
was lying in state under the sky at Samoa, awaiting burial,
say, replying to the toast of his health at a public dinner,
that he had been led to write his most popular book by the
perusal of Stevenson’s <i>Treasure Island</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I said to myself,” he naïvely remarked, “that if I could
not write a better book than that in six weeks, I would shoot
myself.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The same man, when another of his books had been dramatised,
and he was called before the curtain on the first night
of its production, informed the audience that it was a very
good play, and that it would be a great success when it was
decently acted. So complacent was he about it that the
friend who tried to pull him back behind the curtain by
the tails of his dress-coat failed until he had split the coat
up to the collar.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>This man has the very best instincts, but he has a genius
for poking his finger into people’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c016'>I once knew the brother of a Bishop, who left the Church
of England, and went to America to be a Unitarian clergyman,
because he wished to marry a pretty American heiress,
and he had a wife already in England. By and by his new
sect heard of it, and expelled him with conscious or unconscious
humour for “conduct incompatible with membership
in the Unitarian Church.” He hired a hall from the piano
company opposite, and nearly the whole congregation moved
across the street with him. Except in the matter of monogamy,
he was a most Christian man, and his congregation
had the highest respect and affection for him and his bigamous
wife; and this in spite of the fact that he constantly alluded
to the Trinity as he warmed to his subject in sermons for the
edification of Unitarians. If he noticed it, he corrected himself
and said Triad. He was one of the most delightful men
I ever met, and his influence on his congregation was of the
very best.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the days when I saw so much of actors at our own flat,
and went every Sunday night to the O.P., I was once asked
to arbitrate in a dispute between an actor-manager and the
critic of a great daily, who had exchanged “words” in the
theatre. The critic either dreaded the expense of a lawsuit,
or had no desire to make money if he could obtain the <i>amende
honorable</i>. I heard all they had to say, and then I turned
round and said to the great actor, “Did you say that about
Mr. ——?” and he replied with an Irishism which I got
accepted as an apology: “I really couldn’t say; I’m such a
liar that I never know what I have said and what I haven’t
said.”</p>

<p class='c016'>These are stories to which I could not append the names,
but the reader will find as good and better if he turns up the
names of S. H. Jeyes, Oscar Wilde and Phil May in the index.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER I<br /> <br /><span class='c022'>MY LIFE (1856-1886)</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>I was</span> born on February 5, 1856, in the town-house of
my maternal grandfather. My father, a solicitor by profession,
who died in the last days of 1910, at the age of
eighty-six, was almost the youngest of the sixteen children
of my paternal grandparents, John Baker Sladen, D.L.,
J.P., of Ripple Court, near Dover, and Etheldred St. Barbe.
The name St. Barbe has been freely bestowed on their
descendants because the first St. Barbe in this country has
the honour of appearing on the Roll of Battle Abbey.</p>

<p class='c016'>My maternal grandparents were John Wheelton and Mary
Wynfield. Mr. Wheelton (I was never able to discover any
other person named Wheelton, till I found, among the
survivors of the loss of the <i>Titanic</i>, a steward called Wheelton;
truly the name has narrowly escaped extinction), from whom
I get my third Christian name, was in business as a shipper
on the site of the General Post Office, and was Master of the
Cordwainers’ Company. He was Sheriff of London in the
year of Queen Victoria’s marriage. Though he lived at
Meopham near Tonbridge, he came from Manchester, and
I am, therefore, a Lancashire man on one side of the house.
But oddly enough I have never been to Manchester.</p>

<p class='c016'>Charles Dickens, when he first became a writer, was a
frequent guest at his hospitable table, and has immortalised
him in one of his books. He was in a way immortalised by
taking a leading part in one of the most famous law cases in
our history, Stockdale <i>versus</i> Hansard. As Sheriff he had
to levy an execution on Hansard, the printer to the House
of Commons, who had published in the reports of the debates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>a libel on Mr. Stockdale. The House declared it a breach of
privilege, and sentenced the Sheriff to be imprisoned in the
Speaker’s house, from which he was shortly afterwards
released on the plea of ill-health. But with the City of
London as well as the Law Courts against them, the members
of the House of Commons determined to avoid future collisions
by bringing in a bill to make the reports of the proceedings
of Parliament privileged and this duly became law.</p>

<p class='c016'>I have in my possession an enormous silver epergne,
supported by allegorical figures of Justice and others, which
the City of London presented to my grandfather in honour
of this occasion, with a few survivors of a set of leather fire-buckets,
embellished with the City arms, which now do
duty as waste-paper baskets.</p>

<p class='c016'>I was baptised in Trinity Church, Paddington, and shortly
afterwards my parents went to live at 22, Westbourne Park
Terrace, Paddington, continuing there till 1862.</p>

<p class='c016'>It was in this year that my last sister, Mrs. Young, was
born, just before we changed houses. My eldest sister, who
married the late Rev. Frederick Robert Ellis, only son of
Robert Ridge Ellis, of the Court Lodge, Yalding, Kent, and
for many years Rector of Much Wenlock, was born in 1850.
My second sister, who married Robert Arundel Watkins,
eldest surviving son of the Rev. Bernard Watkins, of Treeton,
and afterwards of Lawkland Hall, Yorkshire, was born in
1851; and my brother, the Rev. St. Barbe Sydenham Sladen,
who holds one of the City livings, St. Margaret Patten, was
born in 1858.</p>

<p class='c016'>My father, having become better off by the death of my
two grandfathers in 1860 and 1861, bought a ninety-six
years’ lease of Phillimore Lodge, Campden Hill, which I
sold in 1911.</p>

<p class='c016'>I believe that I never left London till I was four years
old, when we all went to stay with my uncle, the Rev. William
Springett, who still survives, at Dunkirk Vicarage, near
Canterbury. While we were there I first saw and dipped
my hands in the sea, which I was destined to traverse so
often, at a place called Seasalter, to which we drove from
Dunkirk.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>From 1862 to 1868, when my mother died, we children
generally spent the summer at Brighton, from which my
father went away to a moor in Yorkshire for the grouse-shooting.
As a child, I soon grew tired of Brighton, which
seemed so like a seaside suburb of London. I used to think
that the sea itself, which had no proper ships on it, was like
a very large canal. I longed for real sea, like we had seen
at Deal, where we went to stay in my grandmother Sladen’s
dower-house, shortly after our visit to Dunkirk. There we
had seen a full-rigged ship driven on to the beach in front of
our house in a gale, and had seen the lifeboat and the Deal
luggers putting out to wrecks on the Goodwin Sands, and
had seen the largest ships of the day in the Downs. I
loved the woods we had rambled in, between Dunkirk and
Canterbury, even better still. I never found the ordinary
seaside place tolerable till I became enamoured of golf.
Without golf these places are marine deserts.</p>

<p class='c016'>I never tasted the real delights of the country till we
went in the later ’sixties to a farmhouse on the edge of the
Duke of Rutland’s moors above Baslow, in Derbyshire.
With that holiday I was simply enchanted. For rocks meant
fairyland, as they still do, to me. And there I had, besides
rocks, like the Cakes of Bread, the clear, trout-haunted
mountain-river Derwent, and romantic mediæval architecture
like Haddon Hall. Besides, we were allowed to run wild
on the farm, to sail about the shallow pond in a cattle-trough,
to help to make Wensleydale cheeses (this part of Derbyshire
arrogates the right to use the name), and to hack the garden
about as much as we liked. It was there that I had my first
real games of Red Indians and Robinson Crusoe, and there
that I had the seeds of my passion for architecture implanted
in me.</p>

<p class='c016'>We drove about a great deal—to the Peak, with its caverns
and its queer villages, to the glorious Derbyshire Dales, and
to great houses like Chatsworth. Certainly Baslow was my
fairy-godmother in authorship, and my literary aspirations
were cradled in Derbyshire. My father gave me a good
schooling in the beauties of England. We were always taken
to see every place of any interest for its scenery, its buildings,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>or its history, which could be reached in a day by a pair of
horses from the house, where we were spending our summer
holidays. He had the same <i>flair</i> for guide-books as I have,
and taught me how to use them intelligently.</p>

<p class='c016'>Up till 1864 I was taught by governesses with my elder
sisters. There were three of them, Miss Morrison, Miss Bray,
and Miss Rose Sara Paley, an American Southerner, whose
parents had been ruined by the Civil War. She was a very
charming and intelligent woman, and taught my eldest sister
to compose in prose and verse. For a long time this sister
was the author of our home circle. I was too young to try
composition in those days, but seeing my eldest sister do it
familiarised me with the idea of it. I also had a music
mistress, because it was hoped that playing the piano would
restore my left hand to its proper shape, after the extraordinary
accident which I had when I was only two years
old. She was Miss Rosa Brinsmead, a daughter of the John
Brinsmead who founded the famous piano-making firm. The
point which I remember best about her was that she had
fair ringlets like Princess (now Queen) Alexandra, who had
just come over from Denmark and won all hearts.</p>

<p class='c016'>The accident happened by my falling into the fireplace,
when my nurse left me for a minute. To raise myself up
I caught hold of the bar of the grate with my left hand, and
scorched the inside out. It is still shrivelled, though fifty-five
years have passed since that awful day for my mother,
when she found her only son, as she thought, crippled for
life.</p>

<p class='c016'>But though it chapped terribly every winter, and would
not open properly for the next three or four years, I soon
got back the use of my hand, and no one now suspects it of
being the least disfigured till I hold it open to show them.
The back was uninjured, and it looks a very nice hand by
X-rays, when only the bones are visible.</p>

<p class='c016'>The doctor recommended that, being a child of a very
active brain (I asked quite awkward questions about the
birth of my brother shortly afterwards), I should be taught
to read while I was kept in bed, as the only means of keeping
my hand out of danger, and I was given a box of letters which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>I always arranged upon the splint of my wounded hand.
By the time that it was well I could read, and on my fifth
birthday I was given the leather-bound Prayer-book which
I had been promised whenever I could read every word
in it. I have the Prayer-book still, half a century later.</p>

<p class='c016'>Poor Miss Brinsmead had a hopeless task, for though I
could learn to read so easily, I never could learn to play on
the piano with both hands at the same time, except in the
very baldest melodies, like “God Save the Queen,” and the
“Sultan’s Polka.” These I did achieve.</p>

<p class='c016'>In 1864 I was sent to a dame’s school in Kensington
Square, kept by the Misses Newman, from which I was
shortly afterwards transferred to another kept by Miss
Daymond, an excellent teacher, where I had Johnny and
Everett Millais, and sons of other great artists, for my
schoolfellows.</p>

<p class='c016'>In 1866, though it nearly broke my mother’s heart, I
was sent to my first boarding-school, Temple Grove, East
Sheen—in the old house where Dorothy Temple had lived,
and Henry John Temple, Viscount Palmerston, the greatest
of that illustrious race, was born—the school, moreover,
which had numbered Benjamin Disraeli among its pupils.
How many people are there who know that Dizzy was
schooled in the house in which Palmerston was born—those
two great apostles of British prestige?</p>

<p class='c016'>Here I stayed for three years before I won the first junior
scholarship at Cheltenham College, and here, from my
house-master, I had a fresh and wonderful department of
knowledge opened to me, for he used to take me naturalising
(both by day and by night, when the other boys were
in bed) on Sheen Common, then wild enough to have snakes
and glow-worms and lizards, as well as newts and leeches,
and rich in insect prizes. I won this favour because he
accidentally discovered that I knew “Mangnall’s Questions”
and “Common Subjects” by heart. But though he
was Divinity Master, he never discovered that I knew my
Bible quite as well.</p>

<p class='c016'>He also taught me to lie. I had never told a lie till I
went to Temple Grove. But as he prided himself on his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>acuteness, he was constitutionally unable to believe the
truth. It was too obvious for him. When I found that he
invariably thought I was lying while I still obeyed my
mother’s teaching, and was too afraid of God to tell a lie,
I suddenly made up my mind that I would humour him,
and tell whatever lie was necessary to this transparent
Sherlock Holmes. After this he always believed me, unless
I accidentally forgot and told him the truth. And I liked
him so much that I wished him to believe me.</p>

<p class='c016'>He did not injure my character as much as he might have
done, because I was born with a loathing for insincerity.
The difficulty came when he and Waterfield, the head
master, questioned me about the same thing, for Waterfield
mesmerised one into telling the truth, and he tempted one
to tell a lie. It reminds me now of Titian’s “Sacred and
Profane Love.”</p>

<p class='c016'>At Temple Grove I acquired my taste for games and taste
for natural history.</p>

<p class='c016'>In 1868, my mother, to whom I was passionately attached,
died. I used to dream that she was alive for months afterwards.
And the great theosophist to whom I mentioned this
sees in it an astral communication. To divert my thoughts
from this, the greatest grief I had ever had, I was sent to
stay with my cousin, Colonel Joseph Sladen, who had already
succeeded to Ripple Court, and was then a Gunner Captain,
stationed at Sheerness. He belonged to the Royal Yacht
Squadron, and had a schooner yacht in which we used to
go away for cruises up the Channel. I was a little boy of
twelve, and his two eldest sons, Arthur Sladen, now H.R.H.
the Duke of Connaught’s Private Secretary in Canada, and
Sampson Sladen, now the Chief of the London Fire Brigade,
were hardly more than babies, but I enjoyed it very much,
because I was interested in the yachting and in the firing
of the hundred-pounder Armstrongs, which were the monster
guns of those days. We went in my cousin’s yacht to see the
new ironclad fleets of Great Britain and France, and we went
over the <i>Black Prince</i> and the <i>Minotaur</i>, the crack ships of
the time.</p>

<p class='c016'>A year after that, exactly on the first anniversary of my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>mother’s death, I went to Cheltenham College, where I had
taken a scholarship. I was at Cheltenham College six years,
and took four scholarships and many prizes at the school,
the most interesting of which, in view of my after life, was
the prize for the English Poem. I was also Senior Prefect,
Editor of the school magazine, Captain of Football, and
Captain of the Rifle Corps. I shot for the school four times
in the Public School competitions at Wimbledon, and in 1874
won the Spencer Cup, which was open to the best shot from
each of the Public Schools. I was the school representative
for it also in 1873.</p>

<p class='c016'>At Cheltenham, I suppose, I laid the foundations of my
literary career, because, besides editing the school magazine
for a couple of years, and writing the Prize Poem, I read
every book in the College library. It was such a delight to
me to have the run of a well-stocked library. The books at
home were nearly all religious books. I was brought up on
the sternest low-Church lines; we went to church twice a day
on Sunday, besides having prayers read twice at home, and
hymns sung in the afternoon. The church we attended was
St. Paul’s, Onslow Square, where I had to listen to hour-long
sermons from Capel Molyneux and Prebendary Webb-Peploe.
The dull and long services were almost intolerable,
except when Millais, the great painter, who had the next
pew, asked me into his pew to relieve the crush in ours.
Millais sat so upright and so forward when he was listening
that my father could not see me, and I used to bury my
face in the beautiful Mrs. Millais’ sealskin jacket; I had
such an admiration for her that I did not go to sleep. Millais—he
was not Sir John in those days—did not make his children
go to church; I suppose he went because he was fascinated
by the eloquence of the sermons. Molyneux, Marston and
Peploe were all great preachers, though they bored an unfortunate
small boy to the verge of nervous prostration.
We were only allowed to read Sunday books on Sunday, and
the newspapers were put away, as they were to the day of
my father’s death in 1910.</p>

<p class='c016'>After my mother’s death I always longed to get back to
school, because, though we had to go to chapel every day,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>and twice on Sunday, there was not that atmosphere of
religion which made me, as a small boy, begin to feel unhappy
about lunch-time on Saturday, and not thoroughly relieved
till after breakfast on Monday. I hated Sunday at home;
the two-mile walk to and from church was the best part
of it.</p>

<p class='c016'>I have forgotten two other preparations for a literary
career which I perpetrated at Cheltenham. I and my
greatest friend, a boy called Walter Roper Lawrence (now
Sir W. R. Lawrence, Bart., G.C.I.E.), who afterwards rose
to a position of the highest eminence in India, wrote verses
for the school magazine, and I published a pamphlet to
avenge a contemptuous reference, in the Shotover Papers,
and was duly summoned for libel. The late Frederick
Stroud, the Recorder of Tewkesbury, who was at that time a
solicitor, got me off. I never saw him in after life, which
I much regretted, because he was, like myself, a great student
of everything connected with Adam Lindsay Gordon, the
Australian poet. He died while I was writing our life of
Gordon.</p>

<p class='c016'>At the beginning of 1875 I won an open classical scholarship
at Trinity College, Oxford, where I commenced residence
in the following October. At Oxford again I read voraciously
in the splendid library of the Union.</p>

<p class='c016'>There my love of games continued unabated. I shot
against Cambridge four years, and won all the shooting
challenge-cups. I also played in the ’Varsity Rugby Union
Football XV when I first went up.</p>

<p class='c016'>I had delightful old panelled rooms on Number 7 staircase—a
chance fact, which won me a great honour and pleasure.
One afternoon, when I came in from playing football, the
College messenger met me, saying, “Grand company in your
rooms this afternoon, Mr. Sladen—the President, and all the
Fellows, and Cardinal Nooman,” and he added, “When the
President looked at your mantelpiece, sir, he <i>corfed</i>.” My
mantelpiece was strewn with portraits of Maud Branscombe,
Eveleen Rayne, Mrs. Rousby, and other theatrical stars of
that day—about a couple of dozen of them.</p>

<p class='c016'>Shortly afterwards the President’s butler arrived with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>note, which I supposed was to reproach me with the racy
appearance of my mantelpiece, but it was to ask me to spend
the evening with the President, because Cardinal Newman
had expressed a desire to meet the present occupant of his
rooms.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Cardinal, a wan little man with a shrivelled face and
a large nose, and one of the most beautiful expressions which
ever appeared on a human being, talked to me for a couple
of hours, prostrating me with his exquisite modesty. He
wanted to know if the snapdragons, to which he had written
a poem, still grew on the wall between Trinity and Balliol;
he wanted to compare undergraduate life of his day with the
undergraduate life of mine; he asked me about a number of
Gothic fragments in Oxford which might have perished
between his day and mine, and fortunately, I had already
conceived the passion for Gothic architecture which pervades
my books, and was able to tell him about every one. He
told me the marks by which he knew that those were his
rooms; he asked me about my studies, and hobbies, and aims
in life; I don’t think that I have ever felt any honour of the
kind so much.</p>

<p class='c016'>At Oxford I spent every penny I could afford, and more,
on collecting a library of standard works, and I have many
of them still. I remember that the literary Oxonians of that
day discussed poetry much more than prose, and could mostly
be classified into admirers of William Morris and admirers of
Swinburne, and I think the Morrisians were more numerous.
All of them had an academic admiration for Matthew Arnold’s
poems, and could spout from “Thyrsis” and the “Scholar
Gipsy,” which was compared with Keats’ “Ode to a
Nightingale.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Thackeray’s daughter (Lady Ritchie) was at that time the
latest star in fiction, as I occasionally remind her.</p>

<p class='c016'>I had the good fortune to know some of the greatest of the
authors who lived at Oxford when I was an undergraduate—Max
Müller, Bishop Stubbs the historian, Edward Augustus
Freeman, Lewis Carroll, Dean Kitchin, Canon Bright and
W. L. Courtney.</p>

<p class='c016'>Oxford in those days (as I suppose it does still) revolved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>largely round “Bobby Raper,” then Dean of Trinity, a
man of infinite tact and kindness, swift to discern ability
and character in an undergraduate, and to make a friend
of their owner, and blessed with a most saving sense of
humour. When they had finished at Oxford, a word from
him found them coveted masterships, or secretaryships to
Public Men. He was the link between Oxford and Public
life, as much as Jowett—the “Jowler” himself—who sat
in John Wycliffe’s seat at Balliol. Lord Milner, St. John
Brodrick and George Curzon have gone farthest of the
Balliol men of my time. Asquith was before me, Edward
Grey after. Trinity ran to Bishops. Most of the men
who sat at the scholars’ table at Trinity in my time who
went into Holy Orders are Bishops now, Archie Robertson,
now Bishop of Exeter, being the senior of them, Bishop
Gore of Oxford, who had rooms on the same floor as I had,
and was one of my greatest friends in my first year, was the
Junior Fellow. He was a very well-off young man, and used
to spend huge sums on buying folios of the Latin Fathers,
and then learn them by heart. There is no one who knows
so much about the Fathers as the Bishop of Oxford. The
present Archbishop of Canterbury was at Trinity, but before
my time, and so was Father Stanton, who went there because
he came of a hunting family, and it was a hunting College,
and he was a Rugby man. Bishop Stubbs and Freeman were
also Trinity men, and generally at the College Gaudies, where
the Scholars used to dine at the same table as the Dons and
their guests. Sir Richard Burton came once to a Gaudy
when I was there, and told me that he was very surprised
that they had asked him, because he had been sent down.</p>

<p class='c016'>I said, “You are in very good company. The great Lord
Chatham and Walter Savage Landor were sent down from
Trinity as well as you.”</p>

<p class='c016'>But one well-known literary man of the present day holds
the record over them all, because he was sent down from
Trinity twice.</p>

<p class='c016'>Although I was a classical scholar, I refused to go in for
Classics in the Final Schools. “Greats,” otherwise <i>Literæ
Humaniores</i>, as this school is called at Oxford, embraces the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>study of Philosophy in the original Greek and Latin of Plato,
Aristotle and Cicero, and Philosophy and Logic generally.
I was sick of the Classics, and I never could take the smallest
interest in Philosophy, so I knew that I should do no good
in this school, and announced my intention of going in for
the School of Modern History. This was too revolutionary
for my tutor. He said—</p>

<p class='c016'>“Classical scholars are expected to go in for Greats, and
if you fail to do so, we shall have to consider the taking away
of your scholarship.”</p>

<p class='c016'>I was astute in my generation; I went to Gore (the Bishop),
who was my friend, and always met undergraduates as if he
were one of themselves, and said to him, “Will you do
something for me, Gore?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It depends on what it is,” he replied, with his curious
smile.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Tell the Common-room (<i>i. e.</i> the Dons, who used to
meet in the Common-room every night after dinner) that I
really mean to go in for History whether they take away my
scholarship or not, but that if they do take it away, I shall
take my name off the books of Trinity and go and ask Jowett
if he will admit me at Balliol. You were a Balliol undergrad;
you know the kind of answer that Jowett would
make to a man who was willing to give up an eighty pounds
a year scholarship in order to go in for the School which
interested him.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Jowett will take you,” he said, “but I will see what
can be done here.”</p>

<p class='c016'>That night I received the most unpleasant note an undergraduate
can receive—a command to meet the Common-room
at ten o’clock the next morning. They were all present
when I went in. The President invited me to take a seat,
and my tutor (the Rev. H. G. Woods, now Master of the
Temple, of whom I still see something) said—</p>

<p class='c016'>“Are you quite determined to go in for the School of
History, Mr. Sladen?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Quite,” I replied.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Then we hope that the degree you take will justify us in
assenting to such a very unusual procedure.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Then they all smiled very pleasantly, and I thanked them
and went out.</p>

<p class='c016'>They must have felt quite justified when, two years afterwards,
I took my First in History with congratulatory letters
from all my examiners, while all the scholars of Trinity who
went in for the <i>School of Literæ Humaniores</i> took Seconds
and Thirds. I should have got a Fourth, I am convinced.</p>

<p class='c016'>Again I read voraciously. For the first year I hardly
bothered about my text-books at all. I read biographies,
books about architecture and art and literature, historical
novels, the writings of historical personages, everything
which threw brilliant sidelights on my subject. And in the
second year I learnt my text-books almost by heart, except
Stubbs’s <i>Constitutional History</i> and <i>Selected Charters</i>. I
simply could not memorise them—they were so dry, and I
hated the dry bones of <i>Constitutional History</i> almost as badly
as philosophy. I learned digests of them, which took less
time, and were no dryer, and proved equally efficacious in
answering the papers.</p>

<p class='c016'>In after years, when I was entertaining Bishop Stubbs
at a reception, which Montague Fowler and I gave in honour
of Mark Twain at the Authors’ Club, he roared with laughter
when I told him that I got a First in History without reading
his books, by learning the Digests of them by heart.</p>

<p class='c016'>He said, “I know they are dreadfully dull. Did you find
my lectures very dull when you came to them?” He had
not forgotten that I had attended his lectures for a couple
of years.</p>

<p class='c016'>I said, “No, not at all.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Honestly, did you get any good from them?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Quite honestly?”</p>

<p class='c016'>He nodded.</p>

<p class='c016'>I said, “Not in the usual way.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well,” he asked, “how did you get any good from
them?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You must forgive me if I tell you.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Tell me; it cannot be worse than what you said about
my books.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well,” I confessed, “the reason why I attended your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>lectures was that you never bothered as to whether I was
there or not, and I hardly ever was there. I did not think any
lectures were any good, but my tutor made me attend sixteen
a week, and the time which I was supposed to spend at your
lectures, I used to spend in my rooms reading. You were
the only gentleman among my lecturers—all the rest used to
call the names, and report me to my tutor if I was absent.”</p>

<p class='c016'>He was immensely tickled, and said, “You deserved to get
a First, if you took things as seriously as that.”</p>

<p class='c016'>But Bishop Stubbs was very human. He always read the
lightest novel he could lay hands on before he went to bed,
to relieve his mind after working, and save him from insomnia.</p>

<p class='c016'>“They are so light,” he said, “that I keep other books
in front of them in my book-case.”</p>

<p class='c016'>As an author, I have found the education I was given and
gave myself a very useful foundation. Those ten years I
gave to the study of Latin and Greek and classical history
and mythology were not thrown away, because I have
written so many books about Italy and Sicily and Egypt, in
which having the classics at my fingers’ ends made me
understand the history, and the allusions in the materials
I had to digest. It is impossible to write freely about Italy
and Greece unless you know your classics.</p>

<p class='c016'>The two years of incessant study which I gave to taking
my degree in Modern History at Oxford have been equally
useful, because it is impossible to write guide-books and
books of travel unless you have a sound knowledge of history.</p>

<p class='c016'>For a brief while my degree in history had a most practical
and technical value, for it won me the Chair of Modern
History in the University of Sydney, New South Wales.</p>

<p class='c016'>Beyond a week or two in Paris, I had never left England
before I went to Australia in the end of 1879, a few months
after I left Oxford, but I knew my England pretty well,
because my father had always encouraged me to see the
parts of England which contained the finest scenery and the
architectural <i>chefs d’œuvres</i>, like cathedrals. Ireland I had
never visited, and of Scotland I only knew Dumfriesshire,
where my father rented a shooting-box and a moor for four
years; and where I had enjoyed splendid rough shooting when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>I was a boy, in the very heart of the land of Burns. “The
Grey Mare’s Tail” was on one shooting which we had, and the
Carlyle cottage was right under our Craigenputtock shooting.</p>

<p class='c016'>When I left Oxford my father gave me three hundred
pounds to spend on a year of travel, and I chose to go to
Australia to stay with his eldest brother, Sir Charles Sladen,
K.C.M.G., who had been Prime Minister of the Colony of
Victoria, and was at that time leader of the Upper House, and
of the Constitutional Party in Victoria. I wanted to see if
I should like to settle in the Colonies, and go to the Bar with
a view to a political career. We were not rich enough for
me to think of the House of Commons seriously, and I have
always taken a very keen interest in politics.</p>

<p class='c016'>Further, I wanted to go and stay on my uncle’s station
to get some riding and shooting, and to see something of the
outdoor life of Australia, of which I had heard so much.
And I wanted desperately to try living in a hot country. I
knew by intuition that I should like heat.</p>

<p class='c016'>I had not been staying with my uncle for a year before
I had made up my mind to live in Australia, a conclusion to
which I was assisted by my marriage with Miss Margaret
Isabel Muirhead, the daughter of a Scotsman from Stirling,
who had owned a fine station called the Grampians in the
Western District of Victoria, and had been killed in a horse
accident. As I had not been called to the Bar before I left
home, I found that I had to go through a two years’ course,
and take a law degree at the Melbourne University. This
I did, though the position was sufficiently anomalous. For
instance, I had to attend lectures by a Member of the Government,
the Solicitor-General. I knew him intimately at the
Melbourne Club and in private life, and we generally used to
walk down to the Club after the lecture. Sometimes we
went into a pub, to have a drink together, and we discussed
anything from the forthcoming Government Bills to Club
stories. He told me one day, before the public knew anything
about it, of the intention of the Government to bring
in a Bill to make sweeps on racing illegal. As much as forty-five
thousand pounds had been subscribed for the Melbourne
Cup Sweep the year before.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>I said, “It is no good making them illegal; it only means
that they will be carried on under the rose, and that a whole
lot of the sweeps will be bogus. You can’t stop sweeps; all
you can do is to put the bogus sweep on a level with Jimmy
Miller’s.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“What would you do, then?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, if you really want to stop them, you should legalise
them, and put a twenty-five per cent., or fifty per cent. for
the matter of that, tax upon them. You’d spoil the odds
so that sweeps would die a natural death; and if they didn’t,
you’d get a nice lot of money to save the taxpayer’s pocket.
You would be like the Prince of Monaco, who lives by the
gambling at Monte Carlo.”</p>

<p class='c016'>He duly put the suggestion before the Government, but
they thought that this would be paltering with eternal sin,
and passed their Bill to help the bogus-sweep promoter.</p>

<p class='c016'>This same man and I were asked one night to take part
in a Shakespeare reading at the Prime Minister’s. My friend
was late, and the Prime Minister, who was not a discreet
man, began talking about him. Somebody remarked what
a wonderfully well-informed man he was.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yes,” said the Prime Minister, “my Solicitor-General is
one of those people who know nothing about everything. And
the way he does it is that he never opens a book; he just reads
what the magazines and papers have to say about books.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Suddenly the Premier felt that his remarks were no longer
being received with enthusiasm, and looking up, saw his
Solicitor-General waiting to shake hands with him.</p>

<p class='c016'>At the Melbourne University I formed one intimate
friendship, which has lasted ever since. Among my fellow-students
was Dr. George Ernest Morrison, the famous <i>Times</i>
correspondent of Peking. He was famous in those days as
the finest football player in the Colony, and he began his
adventures while he was at the University. For months
we missed him; nobody knew where he was—or if his father,
who was head master of Geelong College, did know, he never
told. Then suddenly he turned up again, and said that he
had been walking from Cape York, which was the northernmost
point of Australia, to Melbourne. He had undertaken—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>I don’t think he had any bet on it—to make his way
from Cape York to Melbourne, alone, unarmed and without
a penny in his pocket. In the northernmost part of his
journey, at any rate, there were a great many wild blacks,
and many rivers full of crocodiles to swim. But there are,
of course, no large carnivora in Australia, and a snake can
be killed with a stick. When he was swimming a river he
used to construct a raft, and put his clothes and his pack on
it; he carried a pack like any other sun-downer, and when
he got to a station, did his bit of work to pay for his bed
and supper, and when he left it, if the next station south
was more than a day’s journey, he was given enough food
to carry him through. This is, of course, the universal
custom in Australia when a man is going from station to
station in search of work, such as shearing.</p>

<p class='c016'>He had not a single misadventure. The reason why he
took so long was that his way from station to station naturally
took him out of the direct line to the south, and he made a
stay at some of them. The newspapers were so impressed
with his feat that, shortly afterwards, when the <i>Age</i> organised
an expedition to explore New Guinea, he was given command
of it. That was the last I saw of Morrison till we met a few
years afterwards at my house in London.</p>

<p class='c016'>I never practised for the Melbourne Bar, for no sooner
had I taken my law degree than I was appointed to the
vacant chair of Modern History in the University of Sydney.</p>

<p class='c016'>I had, since I landed in Australia, made my debut as an
author, and had already published two volumes of verse,
<i>Frithjof and Ingebjorg</i> and <i>Australian Lyrics</i>. During the
year that I held my chair, we had apartments in the Old
Government House, Parramatta, which had become a
boarding-house, and spent our vacations on the Hawkesbury
and in the Blue Mountains.</p>

<p class='c016'>While I was at Parramatta I published a third volume of
verse, <i>A Poetry of Exiles</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>Then occurred an event which deprived me of one of my
principal reasons for remaining in Australia, the premature
death of my uncle. This closed my short cut to a political
career; and I had long since come to the conclusion that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Australia was not the place for a literary career, because
there was no real publishing in Australia. Publishers were
merely booksellers, who acted as intermediaries between
authors and printers; they took no risks of publication;
the author paid, and they received one commission as
publishers and another as booksellers. This did not signify
much for verse; the printing bill for books of verse is not
large, and poets are accustomed to bringing out their works
at their own risk in other countries besides Australia. But
a large prose work of a hundred or a hundred and fifty
thousand words is, at Australian prices, extremely expensive
to produce, and when it is produced, has only a small sale
because it does not bear the name of any well-known English
publishing house.</p>

<p class='c016'>So I suddenly made up my mind to return to England.</p>

<p class='c016'>The five years I spent in Australia were fruitful for my
career as an author, though I have never published anything
about Australia, except my own verses, and anthologies of
Australian verse, and a life, and an edition of the poems, of
Adam Lindsay Gordon. The last was phenomenally successful;
I am sure that no volume of Browning has ever sold
so well. And one of the anthologies had a sale of twenty
thousand copies in the first ten years of its existence.</p>

<p class='c016'>Australia supplied exactly the right element for my
development. At Cheltenham I was the most prominent
boy of my time, and the prestige with which I came up from
school gave me a certain momentum at Oxford. So I went
out to Australia with a very good opinion of Public Schools,
and Oxford, and myself.</p>

<p class='c016'>I soon discovered that nothing was of any importance in
Australia except sport and money. If Tennyson or Walter
Scott had gone to a bush-township, he would have been
judged merely by his proficiency or absence of proficiency
as a groom. Horsemanship is the one test of the inhabitants
of a bush-township.</p>

<p class='c016'>In Melbourne and Sydney and on “stations” it was
different. Hospitality was prodigal, and there was a disposition
to regard with charity one’s shortcomings from the
Colonial point of view, and to accept with sympathy the fact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>that one had distinguished oneself elsewhere. The Australian
man is very manly, and very hearty; the Australian woman
is apt to be very pretty, and to have a strong personality—to
be full of character as a lover.</p>

<p class='c016'>The climate of Australia I found absolutely delightful.
It is a land of eternal summer: its winters are only cooler
summers. The unchanging blue of its skies is appalling to
those whose prosperity depends on the rainfall.</p>

<p class='c016'>When I went out to Australia, just after leaving Oxford,
I was enough of a prig to profit very greatly by being suddenly
thrown into an absolutely democratic community. I was
saved from finding things difficult by the fact that I was
born a Bohemian, in spite of my very conventional parentage,
and really did delight in roughing it. The free and easy
Colonial life was a great relief to me after the prim life in
my English home; and staying about on the great stations
in the western district of Victoria, which belonged to various
connections of my family, furnished the finest experience of
my early life. I spent most of my first year in Australia
in that way, returning, in between, to pay visits to my uncle
at Geelong. Being in the saddle every day never lost its
thrill for me, because I had hardly ever been on a horse
before I went to Australia; and wandering about the big
paddocks and the adjoining stretches of forest, gun in
hand—I hardly ever went out without a gun—had something
of the excitement of the books about the American
backwoods which I read in my boyhood. It is true that
I would rather have shot grizzly bears than the native bears
of Australia, mere sloths, and lions and tigers than kangaroos,
but a big “forester” is not to be sneezed at, and Australia
has an extraordinary wealth of strange birds—the cockatoos
and parrots and parakeets alone give a sort of tropical aspect
to the forest, and the snakes give an unpleasantly tropical
aspect, though, fortunately, in Australia, they shrink from
human habitations.</p>

<p class='c016'>When I married I went to live in Melbourne, close to public
gardens of extraordinary beauty and almost tropical luxuriance,
and soon became absorbed in the maelstrom of dancing
and playing tennis, and watching first-class cricket and racing.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>When we went to Parramatta it was easy to make excursions
to the marvellous gorges of the Blue Mountains, which
are among the grandest valley scenery in the world.</p>

<p class='c016'>Everything was large, and free, and sparsely inhabited—most
expanding to the mind, and the glimpse of the tropical
glories of Oriental Ceylon, which I enjoyed for four days
on my voyage home, made me hear the “East a callin’” for
ever afterwards.</p>

<p class='c016'>I found London desperately dull when we returned to it
in 1884. I had no literary friends, except at Oxford, where
we took a house for three months to get some colour into life
again. It was on the banks of the Cherwell, facing the most
beautiful buildings of Magdalen, and the Gothic glories of
Oxford were manna to my hungry soul.</p>

<p class='c016'>The summer, spent in Devonshire and Cornwall and
Scotland, was well enough, and in the winter, which we
spent at Torquay, we had grand scenery and beautiful
ancient buildings, but the climate seemed treacherous and
cold after the fierce bright summers of Australia.</p>

<p class='c016'>I must not forget that I came very near not going to
Australia at all. I felt the parting with my father extremely,
and he was quite prostrated by it. I had, a few days before
starting, been introduced to the captain of the old Orient
liner <i>Lusitania</i>, in which I made the voyage—a hard, reckless
sea-dog—and he did me good service on that occasion. Two
letters came on board for me when we put in at Plymouth to
pick up the last mails and passengers. One of these letters
contained a letter from my father to the effect that if I wished
to give up the passage and return home I might do so. The
captain, for some reason or other, whether from having had
a conversation with my father, or what, suspected that the
letter might have some message of that kind—he may have
had the same thing occurring in his experience before—so he
did not give me the letter till the next day, when I had no
possible chance of communicating with England until I got
to the Cape de Verde Islands. By that time, of course, I
had thoroughly settled down to the enjoyments of the
voyage, and looked at the matter in a different light.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br /><span class='c022'>MY LIFE (1886-1888)</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>About</span> this time I was struck with the idea that for a
person who intended to make his living by writing books,
Travel was a necessity, and while one had no ties, it cost no
more to live in various parts of the Continent than to live
in London.</p>

<p class='c016'>The desire materialised sooner than it might have done,
because Arthur Chamberlain, whom we had met when we
were sharing a house in Scotland with the Wilkies (wife and
daughters of the famous Melbourne doctor), wrote letters,
which would brook no refusal, for us to come and join him at
Heidelberg, where he was now a student, for the Quincentenary
of the Heidelberg University.</p>

<p class='c016'>Before we went abroad we had a foretaste of the many
pilgrimages to archæological paradises which we were to
make. We spent six weeks at Canterbury, peculiarly delightful
to me, because my family have been landowners in East
Kent from time immemorial, which made the neighbourhood
of Canterbury full of landmarks for me, and Canterbury is,
after Oxford, fuller of the Middle Ages than any town in
England. Here, having the run of the Cathedral library
given me by its curator, Dr. Shepherd (I hope I have spelt his
name right), I commenced my studies of Edward, the Black
Prince—the local hero, who lies buried in the Cathedral.
This led to my writing the most ambitious of my poems,
“Edward, the Black Prince.” I wrote it among the ruins of
the old Cathedral Monastery at Canterbury, and the first
edition was printed in the Piazza of Santa Croce at Florence.</p>

<p class='c016'>At Heidelberg, living for economy in a delightful pension
kept by Miss Abraham, who had been the Kaiser’s English
governess, we met the set who pass their years in wandering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>from one pension to another on the Continent. Our immediate
future was marked out for us. One family booked us
for a favourite pension at Zurich, another for Lucerne,
another for Lugano, another for Florence, another for Rome,
another for Castellamare di-Stabia below Pompeii.</p>

<p class='c016'>And so we began the great trek. We summered at Heidelberg.
Autumn in Switzerland was perfectly beautiful,
but the two or three months which we spent in Florence
formed one of the turning-points of my life. It was there
that we found a pension, which called itself an hotel, replete
with the atmosphere and charm and the little luxuries which
Italy knows so well how to give for seven francs a day.
There we met people who came to Florence year after year,
and knew every picture, almost every stone, in it—almost
every ounce of pleasure which was to be got out of it. They
initiated us, in fact, into Florence, which was more of an
education than anything in the world.</p>

<p class='c016'>Florence is Renaissance in architecture, Gothic in feeling.
Its inhabitants, native and foreign, live in the past. It
was here that I, born with a passion for realising the Middle
Ages, acquired the undying desires which have taken me
back so often and for such long periods, and have inspired
me to write so many books about Italy and Sicily. From the
very beginning I plunged into the life of Florence and the
study of things Italian with extraordinary zest.</p>

<p class='c016'>Going on to Rome for a month or two inspired me with the
same feeling for the classics as Florence had inspired in me
for the Middle Ages.</p>

<p class='c016'>I own that, when I was persuaded to go on from Rome to
Castellamare, I did so with certain misgivings. There did
not seem to be the same chances in it. We were going to a
villa outside the town, whose sole attraction seemed to be
that it was six miles from Pompeii.</p>

<p class='c016'>But when we got there, it had a profound influence on
our lives. It proved to be the villa where the Countess of
Blessington had entertained Byron and others of the immortals,
a beautiful southern house, standing on the green hill which
buries in its bosom the ashes of Vesuvius, and the ruins of
Stabiæ, a city which shared the fate of Pompeii. It had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>a vineyard round it; its quaint garden was overrun with sleepy
lizards, which you never catch asleep—the lizards in which
the genius of Italy seems to live.</p>

<p class='c016'>We saw the sunset every night on the Bay of Naples and
Ischia, which all the world was talking about then because
of the earthquake which had lately ravished it. Every night
we saw a tree of fire rising from Vesuvius.</p>

<p class='c016'>We used to spend our days in the orange groves of Sorrento,
or driving in donkey-carts to Pompeii, that city of
the resurrection of the ancient world. The weather was
somnolently mild; for the first time we were eating of the
fruit of the lotus, which we have eaten so often since, and
which has pervaded my writings.</p>

<p class='c016'>If Castellamare had only done that for us, it would be a
milestone in my life, but it also planted the seeds of unrest—<i>die
Wanderlust</i>—in my veins. Some one we met there—I
don’t remember who it was now—had a craze for Greek ruins;
Roman ruins meant nothing to him, he said; there were
only two places for him, Athens and Sicily.</p>

<p class='c016'>In Sicily it was Girgenti which won his heart, not Syracuse
or Taormina, and he almost persuaded us to go there. He
obviously preferred it, even to Athens. But the name meant
nothing to me; I had read of Agrigentum in the classics,
and he showed me photographs of the glorious Greek temples,
which are still preserved in the environs of modern Girgenti.
Athens, on the contrary, had been before my mind ever since
I was a boy. The literature of Greece is, with the exception
of Homer and Theocritus, roughly speaking, the literature
of Athens. I knew most of its principal buildings almost as
well as if I had seen them. I heard the call of Athens, and to
Athens we went from Castellamare.</p>

<p class='c016'>Going there showed how comparatively cheap and easy
it is to get to distant places. We went through Taranto—Tarentum—to
Brindisi; from Brindisi to Corfu, in the Ionian
Islands, the earthly paradise of the fair Nausicaa, and the
empresses of to-day; from Corfu to Patras and Corinth;
from Corinth to Athens.</p>

<p class='c016'>The moral effect began before ever we reached Athens;
it was so vivifying to a student of the classics to pass Tarentum,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>and Cæsar’s Brundusium, the Lesbos of Sappho, the
Ithaca of Ulysses, Corinth and the Piræus.</p>

<p class='c016'>Lesbos! Corinth! Athens! Sappho! Ulysses! there
was romance and undying poetry in the very names.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Greece of those days really was something out of the
beaten track. There were only two little railways of a few
miles each, and there was not an hotel worthy of the name
anywhere outside of Athens. Even in Athens, if you were
not at a first-class hotel, kid’s flesh, and sheep’s-milk butter,
black bread and honey of Hymettus, and wine which was
full of resin, were the staples of diet. But what did it matter?
We lived in a house and a street with beautiful classical
names—we lived in the house of Hermes. And when we
climbed up to the Acropolis at sunset, we were in an enchanted
land midway between earth and heaven, for we were in the
very heart of history surrounded by milk-white columns of
the marble of Pentelicus, and facing a rich curtain of sunset,
which hung over Ægina, and trailed into the waters of the
Bay of Salamis. Athens is gloriously romantic and beautiful,
and Time has laid its lightest fingers on her rocks and ruins,
whose names are the commonplaces of Greek history.</p>

<p class='c016'>We spent some glorious weeks at Athens, made interesting
by the acquaintance of Tricoupis, the famous Prime Minister,
and the presence of the President of my college at Oxford—now
Bishop of Hereford, from whom I heard only the other
day. From Athens Miss Lorimer’s unappeasable hunger
to see the world swept us on, after several happy weeks, to
Constantinople—the outpost of the East in Europe. Constantinople
was one of the most delightful experiences of
my life. There is no call which I hear like the call of the East,
and in Constantinople you have the noblest mosques west of
India, and bazaars almost as barbarous as the bazaars of
North Africa, thronged, like the broad bridge of boats which
crosses the Golden Horn, with the mixed races of the Levant,
in their gay, uncouth costumes. The scene, too, is one of
rare beauty, for the great mosques are rooted in dark cypress-groves,
and rear their domes and minarets on the horizon,
and the calm waters of the Golden Horn and the Sea of
Marmora are dotted with fantastic <i>caïques</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>We spent all too short a time there, dipping into the
bowl of Oriental mystery, in perfect April weather, when
we were called home to meet a sister-in-law coming from
Australia.</p>

<p class='c016'>I had, in the interval, published two more volumes of verse,
<i>A Summer Christmas</i> and <i>In Cornwall and Across the Sea</i>,
and I had printed at Florence <i>Edward, the Black Prince</i>, begun
during that long visit to Canterbury in the spring of 1886,
during which I steeped myself deeper and deeper in the study
of Gothic architecture, not yet realising what an important
part it was to play in my writing.</p>

<p class='c016'>When we returned from Constantinople I had <i>The Black
Prince</i> properly published in England, and though its sales
were trifling, like those of <i>A Summer Christmas</i>, it met with
warm commendation from the critics.</p>

<p class='c016'>Shortly after this we were inspired with the desire to visit
the United States in the autumn of 1888, and as we were
going so far, we determined so stay in one place while we
were in England.</p>

<p class='c016'>The place we chose was Richmond. I had always loved it
since I was a little boy at Temple Grove School in the neighbouring
village of East Sheen. It was sufficiently in the
country for us to pass a spring and summer there without
irksomeness, and sufficiently beautiful and old-fashioned
to satisfy my cravings.</p>

<p class='c016'>At Richmond we took a house in the Queen’s Road, and but
for the very large sum demanded for fixtures, we should have
abandoned our American trip, and taken the part of the Old
Palace which has now been restored at great expense by
Mr. J. L. Middleton, for which I had a great inclination.
Mr. Middleton is a friend of mine and I have been over it many
times with him. It stands right opposite my study window.
We liked Richmond as much then as we do now, except for the
long trail up from the railway station to the Queen’s Road
when we went to the theatre. We were in the Park or on
the adjoining commons every day, watching the operations
of Nature from the growth to the fall.</p>

<p class='c016'>It was a busy time, for I wrote <i>The Spanish Armada</i> on
the occasion of the Tercentenary of the immortal sea-fight,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>and I edited two anthologies of Australian verse, <i>Australian
Ballads</i> and <i>A Century of Australian Song</i>, for Walter Scott,
Ltd. The pleasure of compiling these two anthologies, the
first books by which I ever made any money, was enhanced
because I did them at the unsolicited invitation of the late
William Sharp, the poet and author of the rhapsodies of
“Fiona Macleod,” who afterwards became a dear and intimate
friend. He introduced me to Charles Mackay, the editor
of the famous <i>Thousand and One Gems of English Poetry</i>,
who adopted Marie Corelli as his daughter, and was father
of Eric Mackay. It was through him that I received the
invitation to do the Australian part of the <i>Slang Dictionary</i>,
edited by M. Barrére, the French Ambassador’s brother, for
which also I received some money.</p>

<p class='c016'>These encouragements made me ask my friend, the late
S. H. Jeyes, who went to Trinity, Oxford, on the same day as
I did, and was at the time one of the editors of the <i>St James’s
Gazette</i>, from which he afterwards changed to the <i>Standard</i>,
whether he thought that I ought to go to America, or stay and
pursue my chances in England.</p>

<p class='c016'>He said, “Go; in America they will take you at your own
valuation, and when you get back, it will <i>be</i> your valuation.”</p>

<p class='c016'>And so it came that we took our passages in the old
Cunarder <i>Catalonia</i> from Liverpool to Boston.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER III<br /> <br /><span class='c022'>I GO TO THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>The only literary at-homes I had been to before I went
to America were Edmund Gosse’s in Delamere Terrace,
Louise Chandler Moulton’s in Weymouth Street, and W. E.
Henley’s in an old house in which he resided at Chiswick.</p>

<p class='c016'>I have written elsewhere how the Gosses used to receive
their friends on Sunday afternoons. Not many came, but
those who did come were generally famous in the world of
letters.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mrs. Moulton, on the other hand, often had a crowd at
her receptions. It was in her drawing-room that I first met
Sir Frederick Wedmore, Mrs. Alexander the novelist, and
Coulson Kernahan, and Theodore Watts. She herself was a
charming poet, and liked entertaining poets. I met her
first at Sir Bruce and Lady Seton’s, at Durham House, which
at that time contained the finest collection of modern
paintings in London.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE AUTHOR<br /><i>Drawn by Yoshio Markino</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>It was fortunate that Henley’s friends were devoted to
him, because he was an invalid and could not get about. He
was already a great power in journalism. His paper, called
at first <i>The Scots Observer</i>, and later on <i>The National Observer</i>,
had taken the place of the <i>Saturday Review</i>, which was not
at that time conducted with the ability of the old <i>Saturday</i>.
The men who gathered round him were very brilliant. I
forget what evening of the week it was that he was at home,
but whatever evening it was he kept it up very late, with much
smoke and consumption of whiskey; and the conversation
was always worth listening to. Henley was a magnificent
talker, with a fund of curious knowledge, and he had a
knack of turning the conversation on to some strange kind
of sin or some strange kind of occultism, which was thoroughly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>threshed out by the clever people present. He rather liked
morbid subjects.</p>

<p class='c016'>Edmund Gosse gave me introductions to H. O. Houghton,
head of the publishing firm of Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co.,
and he and Henley and Katherine Tynan gave me introductions
to various authors. But my most useful introduction
I had through my chief American friend of that
time, Ada Loftus, who made the London correspondents
of the <i>New York Herald</i> and the <i>Boston Globe</i> give full-length
announcements of my approaching visit to America—as
long as they would give to William Watson now. They
labelled me in those announcements the “Australian Poet,”
and that label stuck to me during the whole of that visit to
the United States. They asked Mrs. Loftus, I suppose, what I
had done, and she told them that I had written several volumes
of verse about Australia. Be that as it may, those friendly
announcements resulted in so many hospitalities being offered
to us by American authors and literary clubs that we really
did not need our introductions, especially in Boston, where
Mrs. Moulton was waiting to welcome us, and where I had
old schoolfellows—the Peabodys—connected with most of
the leading families.</p>

<p class='c016'>But I did present the introduction to Mr. Houghton—when
does an author neglect an introduction to a publisher?—and
he showed us innumerable kindnesses all the time we remained
in Boston. It was to him that I owed the invitations from
Oliver Wendell Holmes and Whittier, and Longfellow’s
family to visit them in their homes—inestimable opportunities.
We spent three months in Boston, seeing all the best of Boston
literary society and the University bigwigs at Harvard,
and then we went for a month to New York until it was time
for the ice-carnival season at Montreal. At New York, with
Edmund Clarence Stedman, the first of American critics,
as a godfather, the hospitalities of Boston were repeated
to us. But this was not our principal visit to New York.</p>

<p class='c016'>Our first trip to Canada was intensely interesting to us,
because there we were in a new world, where the temperature
was below zero, and the snow several feet high in the streets,
and the ice several feet thick on the great river, up which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>ocean liners come from spring to autumn. The ice-palace
was already built, and rose like a mediæval castle of alabaster;
in the centre of the city the habitants were selling their milk
in frozen lumps in the market; all the world wore furs, for
the poorest could buy a skin of some sort made up somehow.
There were still buffalo-skin coats in those days in plenty,
at three pounds apiece, and those who could not afford a fur
cap to their liking, wore a woollen tobogganing tuque, which
could be drawn down over the forehead and the ears, just
as some of the younger women and the children wore their
blanket tobogganing coats.</p>

<p class='c016'>It was a new world, where nobody skated in the open,
because of the impossibility of keeping the ice free from snow,
and where skating was so universal an accomplishment
that in the rinks people danced on skates as naturally as on
their feet in a ballroom.</p>

<p class='c016'>One soon took for granted the monstrous cold, learned to
swathe in furs every time one left the house, even if it was
only to go to the post, to wear thin boots, because they were
always covered with “arctics” when one went out, and thin
underclothing because one’s furs were so thick out of doors,
and the houses so furiously hot indoors; to have double
windows always closed, and hot air flowing into the room
till the temperature reached 70° and over.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is no wonder that ice-cream, as they call it, is a feature
at dinner in winter in a Canadian hotel.</p>

<p class='c016'>Outside, all the land was white, and all the sky was blue.
Wrapped up in furs, people so despised the intense cold that
there was not one closed sleigh—at Montreal in winter all
the cabs were sleighs. By day we sleighed up the mountain
for tobogganing and came back in time for tea-parties; by
night we sleighed to dances or picnics. The merry jingle of
sleigh-bells was never out of one’s ears; and everything was
so delightfully simple—it was always beer and not champagne—and
every one took an interest in Australia and Colonial
poetry. The tea-parties were generally impromptus got up
on the telephone. Every one in Montreal had a telephone,
though it was only the beginning of 1889.</p>

<p class='c016'>Lighthall, the Canadian littérateur, came to call upon us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>the very first afternoon that we were in Montreal, and he
introduced us to our life-long friends, the Robert Reids, and
the George Washington Stephens’s. Mrs. Reid and Mrs.
Stephens were sisters. Mr. Stephens, the Astor of Montreal,
shortly afterwards became Treasurer of the Colony. Lighthall
introduced us also to Sir William Van Horne, the President
of the great Canadian Pacific Railway, which led to
important results. We only stayed in Canada a month then,
but that was sufficient to convince me that I did not want to
live in a climate where the cold was as dangerous as a tiger.
It was brought home to me in an extraordinary way. I was
out walking with Mrs. Reid’s daughter, coming back from a
tea-party one evening. We saw a drunken man lying in the
gutter. She said, “We must get a sleigh and take that drunk
to the police-station. He will be dead in an hour if he lies
there.”</p>

<p class='c016'>When roused, he was sufficiently coherent to tell us where
he lived, and we took him home. The cold was so intense
that she found one of her ears frost-bitten before she got home;
she had gone out in an ordinary hat instead of a fur cap,
because it was a tea-party and near home. The unexpected
delay in the open air to rouse the man, and driving him home,
made her pay the penalty of risking a frost-bite. We knew
that it was frost-bitten, because it had turned as white as if
it had been powdered. The policeman took up a handful
of snow, and rubbed it for her—another act of ordinary good
Samaritanism in Canada.</p>

<p class='c016'>We went straight down from Canada to Washington to
see the change of Administration from President Cleveland’s
regime to President Harrison’s. The climatic contrast was
strong; Washington was as warm as Rome. Our arctics
and furs looked simply idiotic when we arrived in the
station.</p>

<p class='c016'>The change of Administration in the United States is
invested with a good deal of magnificence. All the important
people in America, who can spare the time, go to Washington
for it. There were many functions during our visit. We
were President Cleveland’s guests at his farewell-party, and
went to all the Harrison functions. Mrs. Cleveland had a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>delightful personality; she was very pretty, very elegant,
very gracious, a tall woman, rather suggestive of the beautiful
Dowager Lady Dudley, with brilliant dark eyes and a
brilliant smile. Cleveland was not a pleasant man to meet.
When I knew him he was a very strong man who had
become very stout. Everything about him suggested power.
His face, in spite of its fleshiness, was very powerful.
He had a deliberate, rather ungracious way of speaking,
and his silences, accentuated by rather resentful eyes, were
worse. But a man who starts to sweep the Augean stable
for America needs these qualities; and he undoubtedly
improved the tone of the party opposed to him in the State
by giving them an opposition which they had to respect.
But he had no conscience in foreign politics.</p>

<p class='c016'>The most interesting house we went to was Colonel John
Hay’s. Hay was a millionaire twice over, and had been
Abraham Lincoln’s private secretary. He was one of America’s
best poets, and no man in the country was more renowned for
his personal charm or his lofty character. He was afterwards
Secretary of State, and Ambassador to Great Britain, and
could have been either then, if President Harrison had been
able to overcome Hay’s rooted objection to office. And
Adalbert Hay, the American Consul-general, who did so much
for captive Britons in the Boer War, was his son.</p>

<p class='c016'>At Hay’s house you met alike the most famous politicians,
the most famous members of the Diplomatic Corps, and the
most famous authors and artists in America. There we met
all the most distinguished members, perhaps I might say the
leaders, of the Republican Party.</p>

<p class='c016'>Washington will always be a bright spot in my memory for
another thing. Henry Savage Landor, the explorer, was
turned out of his room because the whole hotel was wanted
for President Harrison’s party, and as there was not a room
to be had in Washington, he slept for the remainder of the
time on a shakedown in my room. Both he and I used to
spend a great deal of our time with our next-door neighbour
in K Street, General William Tecumseh Sherman, the hero
of the famous march through Georgia in the Civil War—a
grand old man, with a hard-bitten face, but very human.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>I was present at his funeral in New York; thirty thousand
veterans—“the Grand Army of the Republic”—marched
behind the riderless horse, which bore his jack-boots and his
sword.</p>

<p class='c016'>From Washington we went to New York, and stayed there
till the heat drove us back to Canada, where we had an extraordinarily
delightful holiday in store for us. Sir William
Van Horne had invited us to go as the guests of the Canadian
Pacific Railway right over their line from Montreal to Vancouver
and back, and as we had a month or more to spare
before the time we settled for our journey, we went first of
all to the land of Evangeline—Nova Scotia—and afterwards
across the Bay of Fundy to the valley of the St. John river
in New Brunswick, and thence to Quebec and Montreal, where
we were the guests of the Reids, and for a fortnight of the
Stephens’s, in their summer home on the shores of Lac Eau
Clair in the Maskinonge forest, and of Agnes Maule Machar
at Gananoque on the Thousand Islands of the St. Lawrence.</p>

<p class='c016'>This experience of Canadian summer life was an extraordinary
education in beauty. A more perfect summer
could not be imagined; the sky was always blue, the sun
was always vigorous, and there was generally a light breeze.
We half lived on the water, since all Canadians near a river
or lake have canoes and can manage them with the skill
of an Indian. The bathing was enchanting: we could catch
a hundredweight of fish sometimes, in that land of many
waters. The wild flowers and wild fruits of the meadows
and woods were as plentiful as buttercups and daisies in
England; it was a land of many forests, many lakes, many
rivers; mountains near or distant were always in sight.</p>

<p class='c016'>Nor was this all. On the lofty shores of the Bay of
Fundy and the rock of Quebec, and under the “Royal Mountain”
at Montreal there were dear old French houses, built
in the days of the Thirteenth or Fourteenth Louis, and most
of them intertwined in the romance of Canadian history.</p>

<p class='c016'>What a lovely and romantic land it was! And we saw it
to perfection, for Bliss Carman and Roberts, two Canadian
poets, were our guides everywhere. In all my years in
Australia I never had half the enjoyment out of the country-life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>that I derived from those two or three months of a
Canadian summer.</p>

<p class='c016'>The wonders of our journey had hardly begun, though the
first sight of the old fortress of Quebec towering over the St.
Lawrence, and of the historic Fields of Abraham, are events
never to be forgotten.</p>

<p class='c016'>Still, we felt that a new era in our lives was beginning on
that night in early autumn when we steamed out of the chief
station of the world’s greatest railway westwards on a journey
which would not terminate till we stood on the shores of
English Bay, and looked out on to the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p class='c016'>We were so anxious to hurry out west to the new land
that we only spared ourselves a few days at Toronto to cross
Lake Ontario to Niagara, and spend an afternoon and evening
with Goldwin Smith and George Taylor Denison. They
presented such a contrast—Goldwin Smith, the Cassandra
whose voice was always lifted against his country, except
when he was among her enemies, and Denison, a descendant
of the famous Loyalist, and the leader of Canadian loyalty
to England. Denison was the winner of the Emperor of
Germany’s prize for the best book on Cavalry Tactics.</p>

<p class='c016'>From Toronto we had not far to go by train before we
found ourselves at Lake Huron, and took a steamer of the
company, built like a sea-going vessel, to cross those two
vast lakes, Huron and Superior, to Port Arthur. They look
like seas, and have storms as violent, though they are fresh
water, and in Lake Superior, at any rate, you could immerse
the whole of the British Islands. From Port Arthur we
trained to Winnipeg, the city of the plains, where we only
stayed a few days before flying across the prairie—a limitless
plain as broken as the Weald of Kent, jewelled with flowers
in spring, and with game fleeing to the horizon when cover
is short.</p>

<p class='c016'>After three days of eye-roaming, we woke to find our
view barred by the long wall of the Rocky Mountains, like
castles of the gods.</p>

<p class='c016'>At Banff, in the Rocky Mountains, we were to stay to
contemplate the finest open mountain scenery conceivable,
and at the Glacier House to contemplate a glacier, a forest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>and a stupendous peak threatening to overwhelm a mountain
inn. The scenery between the two was finer than anything
in the Apennines, with its torrents dashing between mighty
precipices, and its pine forests sweeping like a prairie fire
over mountain and valley, and its background of heaven-piercing
Alps.</p>

<p class='c016'>We entered the Glacier House at a dramatic moment, for
Jim, the sports’ guide from Missouri, had just finished pegging
out on the floor of one of the sitting-rooms a trophy of his
rifle that took me straight back to the happy hours of my
boyhood which I spent with Captain Mayne Reid—the rust-coloured
skin of a mighty grizzly bear which had turned the
scale at twelve hundredweight. Jim the guide had on a
buckskin coat and breeches, much stained with killing or
skinning the bear: the spectacle was a most impressive one.</p>

<p class='c016'>From the glacier we tore down the valleys of the Thompson
and the Fraser to Vancouver, then a new wooden town perched
on a forest clearing with the tree stumps still scattered about
its roads, but one of the great seaports of the world in embryo—Canada’s
Western Gate, the realisation of the dream of La
Salle.</p>

<p class='c016'>We loved Vancouver, because here we were in a town and
country in the making, with a glorious piece of the forest
primeval preserved for ever as a national park. For a
month we lived there, going every day to see the sun set over
the ocean which divided us from the mysterious Orient—thinking
over all that we had seen of a country which is like
a continent, in that three or four thousand miles’ journey
on the newly-opened line.</p>

<p class='c016'>Then one day a little old bull-dog of a Cunarder, in the
service of the great railway, ran up the harbour, and moored
herself to the wharf beside the railway station. A tall dark
officer, whose voice I heard across the telephone a few hours
before writing these lines, was leaning over the gunwale.
He and our party smiled pleasantly at each other, and he
invited us to go on board. The litter of the Orient was about
the decks. Chinese seamen and Japanese passengers were
talking the pigeon-English of the East to each other. And we
felt that here was the opportunity for stretching our hands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>across to the East. I accepted the omen, and we booked our
passages to Japan—drifting on as we had drifted ever since
we landed at Boston a year before.</p>

<p class='c016'>The stout old <i>Parthia</i> was going to lie a week or two in
port before she turned her head round for Yokohama and
Hong Kong, and we spent most of this time in an excursion
across the strait to Victoria, the capital of Vancouver’s
Island, a little bit of England in the West, with a dockyard
still in Imperial hands.</p>

<p class='c016'>As we returned from Victoria early in November, we met,
on the steamer, Admiral Sir Michael Culme-Seymour, who
was about to be Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean,
on his way back from a Big-horn expedition in the North.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Where are you on your way to?” he asked me.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Japan,” I replied.</p>

<p class='c016'>“What now?” he said; “you must be fond of bad
weather.”</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br /><span class='c022'>I GO TO JAPAN</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>The</span> Admiral’s prognostications were correct. We met
such heavy seas passing Cape Flattery that the ship seemed
to be trying to turn turtle. We were unable to sit on deck
from that day until the day that we sighted Japan, and once
we had to heave-to for eighteen hours. The worst of the
weather being so terrible was that the Captain was unable
to execute the Company’s instructions to take us to see the
Aleutian Islands, which only whalers know, and drop some
stores there for shipwrecked mariners.</p>

<p class='c016'>But on that December morning, when we found ourselves
in smooth water and soft, summery temperature off the
flat-topped hills of Japan, surrounded by the billowing sails
of countless junks, the very first vessels we had seen since
Cape Flattery faded out of sight, we felt rewarded.</p>

<p class='c016'>The East, the Far East, which I had heard “a-calling”
all my life, was right within my grasp. In a few hours’
time I should be standing on the shores of fanciful and
mysterious Japan, able to remain there as long as I chose,
for we had no fixed plans. We were just drifting on—drifting
through our lives—drifting across the world. My heart
beat high; I might have written nothing but a few books
of verse which hardly anybody read, but, at any rate, I had
gone half round the world, and if I wished to stay and
dream for the rest of my life in the East, who was to say
me nay?</p>

<p class='c016'>Whatever the causes, the effect was to give me the subject
for which I had been waiting to make my position as an
author. From the day that I published <i>The Japs at Home</i>,
I shed my label of the “Australian Poet,” and became
known as the author who has been to Japan.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>I even enriched the English language with a word—<i>Japs</i>.
It had long been in use in America, but no one had ventured
to put it into a book in England. Some thought it was
undignified; some thought that it would incense the
Japanese. I not only put it into a book, but on the cover of
a book, which has sold a hundred and fifty thousand copies.
Only to-day I discovered that Japan’s great poet, Yone
Noguchi, and the Japanese publicist, T. G. Komai, use it in
their books, which are written in English.</p>

<p class='c016'>I had, in Montreal, bought a No. 1 Kodak—a novelty
in those days—and with it I took several hundred photographs
in Japan—it was from these that Fenn, the artist,
of McClure’s Syndicate, afterwards drew his illustrations
for my articles, which were reproduced in the earlier editions
of the book. The “Kodaks” not only served as the basis
of the illustrations, they made a most admirable journal
for me to write from.</p>

<p class='c016'>I commenced Kodaking and taking notes from the hour
that we entered the harbour of Yokohama, and kept it up
without flagging till the day that we left Yokohama for
San Francisco. It was to those snapshots with camera and
pencil that my books on Japan owed the lively touches
which gave them their popularity.</p>

<p class='c016'>We were a winter and a spring and a summer in Japan—for
all except six weeks which we spent in China. I paid most
of my hotel bills in Japan by writing my <i>Handbook to Japan</i>
for the Club Hotel Company.</p>

<p class='c016'>In Japan we spent our entire days in sight-seeing. If we
were not going over interesting buildings (and I over Yoshiwaras),
temples, castles, baths or tea-houses in marvellous
gardens—we were wandering about the streets or the country
in our <i>rikishas</i>, dismounting when there was anything to
photograph or examine or purchase. The <i>rikisha</i> is a most
convenient way of getting about for a person who is making
notes, because he can write as he goes along, and pull up
as often as he likes when there is anything which needs
his attention. Also, your <i>Jinrikisha</i> boy, if you choose
carefully, speaks enough English to act as an interpreter,
and, from having taken foreigners to the sights so often, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>usually a tolerably efficient guide. Besides which, it is a
novel, pleasant and exciting method of locomotion.</p>

<p class='c016'>We hired the best two <i>rikisha</i> men we could hear of by
the week, and never regretted the extravagance. They were
always there when we wanted them, and in a very few days
grasped exactly what we wished to do and see. One was
called Sada and the other Taro.</p>

<p class='c016'>It was in this way that I acquired my knowledge of the
Japan which can be seen on the surface, and which is all
that the average foreigner wishes to see, and gave myself
one of the three or four subjects with which my name is
identified.</p>

<p class='c016'>We spent the first month in Yokohama, a much-maligned
place, for it had in those days an unspoiled native town at
the back of the settlement, and its environs were charming,
whether one went towards Negishi or towards Ikegami:
I found enough to keep me hard at work for a month.</p>

<p class='c016'>On the last day of the year we went to Tokyo. We had
a reason for that; we wished to see the great fair in the
Ginza, which is one of the most typical sights of Japan.
Savage Landor, who had been in Tokyo for some time,
wrote that we must on no account miss it, and he took
rooms for us in the Tokyo hotel—which the Japanese called
<i>Yadoya</i>, “the hotel.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The Tokyo hotel was an experience: it had originally
been the <i>Yashiki</i> or town-house of a feudal prince, in the
days when the Shogun reigned at Tokyo. It had a moat
(into which Miss Lorimer, who accompanied us on all our
travels, fell on the first night we were there, but which
fortunately contained more mud than water), and stood in an
angle of the outer works of the castle.</p>

<p class='c016'>Just below it, small craft made a port of the outer moat
of the castle: in its courtyard carpenters were using up
the large amount of waste space which there is in a <i>Yashiki</i>
by nailing fresh rooms on to the Daimio’s house, to make
the hotel larger. It could not be called anything but nailing
on, because it was made of wood and paper, and was not
properly dovetailed into the existing building, but simply
tacked on. We learnt many upside-down notions by watching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>the builders and carpenters, who did most things inside-out
or upside-down, according to our notions. Also the
Japanese manager, the Abè San who was murdered a few
months ago, borrowed my clothes to have them copied by
a Japanese tailor, and the waiters wore their European
clothes over their native dress, and wriggled out of them
behind a screen as soon as a meal was over. If you called
them at such a moment, whatever your sex, they might come
forward with their trousers half on and half off. The Japanese
have their own ideas of conventions between the sexes.</p>

<p class='c016'>Wandering through that fair at the Ginza took one into
the very heart of Japan: it is held to enable people to
settle their debts before New Year’s Day.</p>

<p class='c016'>Apart from the obituary parks of Shiba and Ueno, Tokyo
is not reckoned rich in temples, though it has a few very
famous temples in the suburbs, and more than a few within
a short excursionary distance. But Shiba and Ueno—and
especially the former—present an epitome of Japanese life,
art, scenery and history.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is difficult to imagine anything more beautiful than
Shiba, though the Japanese have a proverb that you must
not call anything beautiful till you have seen Nikko. The
fir woods in which it stands are on a low ridge commanding
an exquisitive view of the Gulf of Tokyo, and in this wood
are embosomed the mausolea of most of the earlier Shoguns
of the Tokugawa House, which came to an end this winter
with the death of the abdicated Shogun. Each mausoleum
has a beautiful temple beside the tomb. The presence of so
many temples has led the Japanese to exhaust their landscape
art on Shiba with lake and cherry-grove and cryptomeria.
Such natives as do not go there for religion are
attracted by the pleasure city, with its famous tea-houses,
like the Maple Club, its shows, and, above all, by its dancing.
Here you may see the <i>No</i>-dance, the <i>Kagura</i>-dance, and some
of the best Geishas.</p>

<p class='c016'>But the chief charm of Shiba to me was its absolute
Orientalness compared to the rest of Tokyo.</p>

<p class='c016'>No sooner are you inside the great red gateway of the
temples than you are in the world of fairy-tales. For temple
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>after temple opens up before you, low fantastic structures,
on which Oriental imagination has run riot in colour and form.
You are bewildered by the innumerable courtyards of stone
lanterns, the paraphernalia of drum-tower and bell-tower,
fountain and dancing-stage, which surround them. You
are sobered by the dark groves between the temples, which
contain the tombs.</p>

<p class='c016'>Temple and tomb are thronged by streams of dignified
natives, some come to worship and some to see the sights.
Here you will find a service going on, with white-robed
priests kneeling on the mirrored floor of black lacquer, for
which you have to remove your boots. Outside the actual
temples the shows are in full blast, and picnicking proceeds
everywhere. All the Japanese are in their native dress.
Gay little musumes and gorgeous geishas flutter before you.
The grand tea-houses offer fresh visions of the Orient with
their Geisha dances and their fantastic gardens.</p>

<p class='c016'>Ueno has the added charm of a large lake, covered with
lotus-blossoms in summer.</p>

<p class='c016'>At no great distance from Shiba is the Shinagawa Yoshiwara,
which, for fantastic beauty, surpasses anything in
Japan. With these and the water life of the Nihombashi,
and the life of the poor going on all day in the streets—for
the poor Japanese takes the front off his house all through
the day to air it—I should have found good occupation for
my notebook and camera for years.</p>

<p class='c016'>If we had not been urged by other foreigners, I do not
know when we should have left Tokyo. And we saw little
enough of them except at meal-times, or when we went to
the Frasers (Hugh Fraser was British Minister of Tokyo,
and husband of the well-known author, Mrs. Hugh Fraser,
Marion Crawford’s sister), or the Napiers. The Master of
Napier, the Lord Napier and Ettrick, just dead, was his
First Secretary. But at meal-times they talked so much of
Easter at Miyanoshita, and the cherry-blossom festival at
Kyoto, and the annual festival at Nikko, and the Great
Buddha at Kamakura, and the sacred shrines of Ise, that we
fortunately felt obliged to visit them.</p>

<p class='c016'>Miyanoshita, the favourite holiday-resort of the Europeans
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>in Japan, is high up in the mountains. The valley on the
right of the long ridge which leads up to it in spring is ablaze
with azaleas and flowering trees. It, itself, is perched on a
mountain-side, above a densely-wooded valley. Exquisite
walks can be taken from it, such as the trip to Hakone, the
beautiful village which stands on the blue lake at the foot
of Fujiyama, in which the immortal grace of the great
mountain is reflected whenever the sun or moon is above
the horizon. Miyanoshita is equally famous for its mountain
air and its mountain baths. The boiling water, highly
impregnated with sulphur, is brought down in bamboo pipes
from the bosom of the mountain to deep wooden baths sunk
in the floor of the hotel bathing-house. Life here is one
long picnic: the energetic take walks, the lazy are carried
in chairs over the hills: people fly here for week-ends in
spring, and from the heat and damp of the summer.</p>

<p class='c016'>Its great rival is Nikko, another mountain village, embosomed
in shady groves, with woods full of wild hydrangeas.
In June Nikko is crowded for the festival of Toshogu, the
deified founder of the dynasty of Shoguns, which was ended
by the revolution of 1868—the principal festival of Japan,
inaugurated with the grandest procession to be seen nowadays,
in which all who take part in it wear the ceremonial
dresses of three hundred years ago.</p>

<p class='c016'>Nikko has the two most beautiful temples in the magic
land—those of Iyeyasu, the founder of the Tokugawa
dynasty, and his grandson, Iyemitsu. Here you see the
most perfect lacquer and carving in all Japan. And their
courtyards are exquisitely terraced on the mountain-side.
Here, too, besides these and other glorious temples, there
are the added charms of scenery, a foaming sky-blue river,
running beneath the sacred scarlet bridge, and between the
avenue of Buddhas, commons of scarlet azalea, and thickets
of wild wistaria.</p>

<p class='c016'>Having seen Nikko, the sacred city of the Shoguns, one
must needs see Kyoto, the city of the Mikados, and Nara.</p>

<p class='c016'>For seven centuries prior to the revolution in our own
day, Kyoto was the capital of the Mikados. Here they lived
like gods behind a veil, only penetrated by the hierarchy:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>they never left the palace gates except in a closed palanquin:
they added little but tombs to the city, and their tombs
were never shown. But the Shoguns, who ruled in their
name, and others great in the land, adorned Kyoto with some
of the greatest and most interesting temples in Japan,
such as the temples of the Gold and Silver Pavilions, the
two Hongwanji temples, the temple of the Thirty-Three
Thousand Images, and the chief temple of Inari the Goddess
of Rice. And it being the ancient capital, we found the city
full of old prints and curios, and the old-fashioned pleasure
resorts of Japan.</p>

<p class='c016'>Kyoto was a city of the pleasure-seeker of old time, as
capitals are wont to be. It has wonderful tea-houses in the
city; its temple grounds are like permanent fairs; and within
a <i>rikisha</i> drive is Lake Biwa, one of the most exquisite lakes
in the world, whose shores exhibit the <i>chefs d’œuvres</i> of
the Japanese landscape-creator. Nothing could be more
exquisite than the temple grounds on the shores of Lake
Biwa.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of the many old-time festivals of Kyoto, the most famous
survival is the Miyako-odori, or cherry-blossom festival,
held every year, when visitors flock to Kyoto to see the
cherry-groves in full blossom. The feature of the festival
is a wonderful ballet, for which the best dancers in Japan
gather in Kyoto. Even the Duke and Duchess of Connaught
came to Kyoto for it, when they were in Japan. We stayed
for a long time at Yaami’s when they were there, and when
the Duke learned from Colonel Cavaye, his private secretary,
that I was a journalist, he gave me permission to accompany
his party to any function or expedition which I wished to
describe. The most interesting of them was the shooting
of the rapids of the Katsuragawa, some miles from Kyoto,
where thirteen miles of cataracts are negotiated in huge
punts, built of springy boards. As we were buffeting down
the rapids, the Duke told me that our present King, then
Prince George of Wales, had said that shooting those rapids,
and the baths of Miyanoshita, where you have natural hot
water in wooden boxes sunk in the floor, were the two best
things in the world.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>In Kyoto, an antique city on a broad plain, embosomed in
hills, capped by temples, one has the very essence of old
Japan. We stayed there a long time, absorbing an atmosphere
which may soon pass away, never to return.</p>

<p class='c016'>Within a day’s <i>rikisha</i> drive of Kyoto is Nara, with its
thousand-year-old treasury of the most notable possessions
of the Mikados, and its glorious temples, and its sacred
deer-park, and its acres of scarlet azalea thickets.</p>

<p class='c016'>We visited all; we visited the two great cities of Osaka
and Nagoya, with their magnificent castles, and Kamakura,
with its gigantic Buddha and its ancient monasteries. We
visited all the most famous cities and points of scenery
in Japan; and the pleasure of our visit was heightened by
our going away to China for six weeks in the middle of it,
because when we came back our eyes were far keener to
observe and to appreciate, while we had the knowledge
acquired in our former visit to guide us.</p>

<p class='c016'>We were truly sorry to leave Japan. I should be quite
content to be living there still; but if we had remained there,
Japan would not have taken its part in my development as
a writer, for though I should doubtless have compiled a book
or books about Japan, they would have been sent home as
the productions of an amateur, and very likely have had
such difficulty in finding a publisher that they would have
been brought out in some hole-and-corner way, instead of
my selling <i>The Japs at Home</i> in the open market, and thereby
laying the foundation of my career as a travel-book writer.</p>

<p class='c016'>Japan supplied me with the material for several books,
not counting the handbook which I wrote for the Club
Hotel—<i>A Japanese Marriage</i>, next in point of sales to <i>The
Japs at Home</i>; <i>Queer Things About Japan</i>, which sold best
of all my books in guinea form; <i>More Queer Things About
Japan</i>, which I wrote with Norma Lorimer; <i>When We Were
Lovers in Japan</i>, a novel which was originally published under
the title of <i>Playing the Game</i>; and <i>Pictures of Japan</i>; while
I have written countless articles and short stories about the
country.</p>

<p class='c016'>I had almost forgotten that I had a book—my <i>Lester the
Loyalist</i>—published in Japan. Though it only contained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>about twenty pages, it took two months to print. How the
result gratified me, I wrote in <i>The Japs at Home</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I forgot all the delays when I saw the printed pages,
they were so beautiful, and really, considering that Mr.
Mayeda was the only man in the establishment who could
read a word of English, the printing was exceedingly correct.
The blocks had turned out a complete success, though, of
course, the proofs of the covers did not look as well as they
would when mounted and crêped.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The Japanese have a process by which they can make
paper crêpe book-covers as stiff as buckram.</p>

<p class='c016'>“‘Well, Mr. Mayeda, how did your little boy like the
stamp-book you mended up for him so beautifully?’ I
asked one day.</p>

<p class='c016'>“‘Ah! it is very sad; he has gone to hell. But the
little boy, he has loved the stamp-book so that he has taken
it to hell with him. It is on his <i>grave</i>, do you call it?’</p>

<p class='c016'>“Mr. Mayeda was thinking of what the missionaries had
told him when he was learning English.</p>

<p class='c016'>“A few weeks more passed. Mr. Mayeda brought us the
perfect book. He was so flushed and tearful that I poured
him a couple of bumpers of vermouth, which he drank off
with the excitement of an unemployed workman in England
when he makes a trifle by chance, and spends it right off
on his beloved gin.</p>

<p class='c016'>“‘Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayeda?’ I asked.</p>

<p class='c016'>“‘It is so sad. My other little boy has gone to hell, too.
And I am so poor, and I have to keep my wife’s uncle, and
my father is very silly, and so I get drunk every night.’</p>

<p class='c016'>“The books he had brought were exquisite. The printing
was really very correct, and the effect of the long hexameter
lines, in the handsome small pica type, on the oblong Japanese
double leaf of silky ivory-tinted paper, every page flowered
with maple-leaves in delicate pearl-grey under the type,
was as lovely as it was unique.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The block printings on every single leaf were done by
hand—the leaf being laid over the block, and rubbed into
it by a queer palm-leaf-pad burnisher.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The covers were marvels of beauty, made of steel-grey
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>paper crêpe, ornamented, the back one with three little
sere and curled-up maple leaves drifting before the wind,
and the front one with a spray of maple leaves in all their
autumn glory and variety of tints, reproduced to the life.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Across the right-hand end of the sprig was pasted a long
white silk label in the Japanese style. The good taste, the
elegance, the colours of this cover, fairly amazed me.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Our visit to China was taken at the instigation of friends
in Japan, who made an annual trip to the Hong Kong races.
I cannot say that it interested me as much as Japan; but
we only had time to visit Hong Kong, Shanghai, Canton and
Macao, and of these, Canton alone was absolutely Chinese.
Canton is as typical a Chinese city as one could desire—supreme
in commerce, a hot-bed of Chinese aspirations.
But it is very poorly off for fine old buildings; it is more
interesting for its huge water population, living in long
streets of boats, and for the wonderful gardens of some of
its merchants.</p>

<p class='c016'>Macao is chiefly interesting as a very ancient outpost of
Europe in the East, old enough for Camoens to have lived
and written his immortal Lusiad there in the sixteenth
century. It has little to call for the attention of the stranger,
except nice old gardens with huge banyan-trees, and gambling
hells, where you learn to play <i>Fan-tan</i>. It only flourishes
as an Alsatia for rogues outside of British and Chinese
jurisdiction.</p>

<p class='c016'>Shanghai is a fine European town, with luxuries and
conveniences, for which Hong-Kongers sigh, and a most
picturesque walled native town, which contains one of the
most beautiful tea-houses in the East.</p>

<p class='c016'>Hong Kong is a gay city, because it is so full of British
naval and military officers. It is also rather a beautiful
place, having a mountain right over the town, which is the
sanatorium and summer-resort. I met many old schoolfellows
there, who took care that invitations should be sent
to us for all the Service festivities, which are so thick at
Race-time. And they also told me what to see in Hong
Kong and Canton and Macao.</p>

<p class='c016'>But, knowing that I was only to be in China for a month
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>and a half, I made no effort to ground myself in knowledge
of everyday China, but gave myself up to enjoying the gaieties
and tropical luxuries.</p>

<p class='c016'>China thus had no effect on my literary development.
Our stay there was a mere holiday, at which I had a fresh
and exhaustive round of military and naval festivities.</p>

<p class='c016'>The island of Hong Kong is not a good place for studying
the Chinaman, except as an employé of the Englishman.</p>

<p class='c016'>On our return from China to Japan we were fascinated by
the almost tropical beauty of the Japanese summer. There
was also a good deal of British gaiety, for the Fleet had moved
just before us from China to Japan.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br /><span class='c022'>BACK TO CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>The</span> Pacific as we crossed it on our return from Japan
to America was very different to the Pacific of our outward
journey. Instead of being on a small ship, so buffeted by
the seas that we could not remain on deck, with hardly
another white passenger on board except missionaries, we
were on a large ship—the finest which crossed the Pacific
in those days—full of “Society” people returning from the
East, and the sea was like the traditional mill-pond.</p>

<p class='c016'>We landed at San Francisco and stayed a week at the
Palace to see something of life in the Californian capital.
It struck me as very like life in Australia, especially in the
character of the buildings and the appearance of the people.
But the cold winds of the San Francisco summer have no
parallel in Australia.</p>

<p class='c016'>The chief effect of my visit to California in the development
of my writing was that, receiving a contract to write
a number of articles for the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, my first
prose writing had to be lively enough to satisfy the lively
Californian audience. This was a good training.</p>

<p class='c016'>From San Francisco we went up the Pacific coast to
Vancouver, with good opportunities for learning the humours
and vulgarities of Western America.</p>

<p class='c016'>The tail-end of summer and the autumn we spent in
working our way back from Vancouver to Montreal, breaking
our journey wherever we felt inclined to try the joys of
wild life in Canada—at the head waters of the Fraser, the
Sicamous lakes in the Kootenay country, various spots on
Lake Nepigon and the wild North shore of Lake Superior,
Lake Nipissing, the Lake of the Woods, Trout Lake, and so
on, besides the chief towns like Winnipeg, and the regular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>tourist stopping-places at Banff and the Glacier House. At
some places we had the opportunity of watching the life of
the Siwashes, or Coast Indians, of Esquimaux blood, who
live chiefly by catching and drying the salmon which we
saw coming up the Fraser like a river of fish in a river of
water. At others we saw the lordly Red Indian—Stony or
Blood or Blackfoot—and on the Rainy Lake we saw two
thousand Ojibways on the war-path—all cartridge-belts and
feathers—camped on the outskirts of a Canadian town
(without inflicting the smallest scare on the inhabitants),
while they were waiting to see if they should have to
go and support the Ojibways across the border in their
war upon a Baltimore Company, which had infringed their
rights.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Indians, in their shrewd way, first tried their luck in
the United States Courts, who decided in their favour, so war
was not declared.</p>

<p class='c016'>At Sicamous we saw eighty fresh skins of black bears, who
had been slaughtered while they were feeding on the salmon
stranded in shallow water, owing to the failure of the berry
crop. In their anxiety to spawn in shallow water, the salmon
crush their way up into tiny brooks and ponds where the
bears can catch them easily, and the farmers sweep them out
of the water with branches.</p>

<p class='c016'>At the Glacier House, Jim the guide’s slaying of the great
grizzly bear, when we were there before, inflamed my imagination.
I cultivated Jim. I climbed the great Assulkan
Glacier with him after the first fall of autumn snow, and
made a vow about glaciers which I have religiously kept;
and having a Winchester sporting rifle with me, I went out
with him to try and get a shot at a grizzly, whose track he
had seen. But we saw no more of that bear, which was,
perhaps, fortunate for me, for though I had won many
prizes at rifle-shooting, I had not been brought face to face
with any dangerous game, and a grizzly decidedly falls into
that category.</p>

<p class='c016'>We had splendid fishing all the way across, and delightful
camping out; and altogether had an experience of outdoor
life in Western Canada, which is very unspoiled and wild—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>snakeless Eden, that certainly told in my development as a
writer.</p>

<p class='c016'>At last the autumn came to an end. We felt the first
breath of winter standing by the river side, where Tom Moore
wrote his famous <i>Canadian Boat Song</i>—the woods were a
glory of crimson and gold.</p>

<p class='c016'>We said good-bye to Canada and turned our footsteps
to New York. There we met a warm-hearted American
welcome. Our numerous friends seemed to find an almost
personal gratification in the fact that we had been to the
Far North-West and to the Far East, to the Pacific Coast
and to Japan and China.</p>

<p class='c016'>I was now no longer exclusively the “Australian Poet,”
I was a sort of mild explorer, and people talked Japan to
me whenever they were not talking about themselves.
There was a good deal of this to do, because I had a
commission from Griffith, Farran &amp; Co. to compile a book
on the younger American Poets, and nearly every one I
met seemed to be a poet.</p>

<p class='c016'>I was sitting next to H. M. Alden, the editor of <i>Harper’s
Magazine</i>, one night at dinner. Suddenly he pulled out his
watch. “It is now nine o’clock,” he said; “at this moment
there are a hundred thousand people in America writing
poetry, and most of them will send it to me.”</p>

<p class='c016'>One of them was the English curate of the most fashionable
church in New York, and he was in a quandary. He wished
to be in the book, but he had heard that there was to be a
biography of each poet, giving his date of birth, parentage,
career, etc. He did not wish his date of birth to be known—he
thought that it would interfere with his prospects as a
lady-killer. “Was it compulsory for him to say how old
he was?” he whined.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You need not tell the truth about it,” I suggested.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the compilation of that book I saw a great deal of human
nature, because I met the poets, whereas in <i>Australian Poets</i>,
which I edited simultaneously, I had to do my work entirely
by correspondence.</p>

<p class='c016'>We spent a delightful winter and spring in New York,
because we had Miss Lorimer’s beautiful sister, Mrs. Hay-Chapman,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>one of the finest amateur pianists I ever heard,
staying with us all the time, so that we had a feast of music,
and as I was doing literary and dramatic criticisms for the
<i>Dominion Illustrated</i>, the leading weekly of Canada, we had
plenty of new books and theatre tickets. This, and the
articles on Japan I was writing for the American Press and
McClure’s Syndicate, kept me quite busy.</p>

<p class='c016'>My sojourn in America had a most important influence
on my literary career, because it taught me my trade as a
journalist. Needing money, and having no connections, I
had to make my way as a journalistic free lance in the open
market, and I succeeded in making a fair income out of it.</p>

<p class='c016'>But I never tried to get a publisher (though one came to
me), for the simple reason that I never contemplated entering
the lists as a prose-writer. A large and well-known firm
bought editions in sheets of my various volumes of verse,
which surprised me very much, till they went bankrupt
shortly afterwards without paying for them. The purchase
was not of sufficient magnitude to be the cause of the
bankruptcy, as the ill-natured might suggest.</p>

<p class='c016'>I have often regretted that I did not form a close personal
connection with a single publishing house over there, instead
of having each individual book, as it was ready, sold to whichever
publisher the agent happens to do business with.</p>

<p class='c016'>Also I blame myself for not learning the art of pleasing
the American novel-reader. Their book market is a much
more valuable one than ours, and unfortunately the worst
fault a novel can have in their eyes is its being “too British.”
A book like <i>The Tragedy of the Pyramids</i> is anathema to
them.</p>

<p class='c016'>The only prose book I published during my sojourn in
America was <i>The Art of Travel</i>, for which the publisher, a
Greek, forgot to pay me a single penny of what he contracted.
I afterwards turned into it an advertisement for
the North German Lloyd, and got something, about fifty
pounds, I think, out of them.</p>

<p class='c016'>I must not take leave of America without recording my
impressions of the other American cities which I visited
besides New York and Boston.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>San Francisco, Seattle, Tacoma and other western towns
were spoiled for me, because the working-classes in them
were so “swollen-headed” and rude that any educated or
gently-born person felt like a victim of the French Revolution
as he was making his way to the scaffold, surrounded by wild
mobs thirsting for his blood. The lower classes in the cities
of the Pacific Coast insult you to show that they are your
equals. And except as manual labourers, they never could
be anybody’s equals, because God created them so common.
It is these people and the unscrupulous speculators who
make money. The decent people get ground between the
upper and lower grindstone in a land where living costs out
of all proportion to the rewards of education.</p>

<p class='c016'>We spent some time also in Washington, which is their
exact converse. Washington has its vulgar rich, who go
there to make a “season” of it, and its venal and lobbying
politicians who make the vast temple, which acts as the
American Capitol, a den of thieves, but they do not take the
first place in the public eye. The really fine elements in
the American nation are well represented at Washington,
and form a natural Court, in which the President may or
may not be prominent. That depends on whether he is
fit to be their leader. It is they, and not the President, who
keep up the traditions of their country before the eyes of
the various Embassies. Such a man was Colonel John Hay.
Their presence helps to make Washington a delightful city.</p>

<p class='c016'>The American Government is extremely polite and hospitable
to visiting authors. I was such a small author in those
days that I felt positively embarrassed when, a few hours
after our arrival in Washington, President Cleveland’s
private secretary, Colonel Dan Lamont, called with an
invitation for us to go to supper with the President and
Mrs. Cleveland and be present at the last reception they gave
before they left the White House.</p>

<p class='c016'>And when President Harrison came into office, Mr. Blaine,
the new Secretary of State, invited us to share his private
box to witness the inaugural procession.</p>

<p class='c016'>These were civilities beyond one’s dreams, and added to
them were the never-ceasing hospitalities at houses like John
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Hay’s, and the Judges’, and the delightful receptions at which
one met the great scientists connected with the Smithsonian
Institute, and the chief authors and editors congregated at
Washington.</p>

<p class='c016'>To witness a change of Administration at Washington and
partake in its hospitalities is extraordinarily stimulating and
interesting. It was a privilege far beyond my deserts to
meet the great public men of America.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <br /><span class='c022'>LITERARY AT-HOMES AND LITERARY CLUBS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>The</span> literary at-home is an American institution. It
may not have been invented there, but it has certainly
flowered there. I did not visualise the literary at-home
at all until I attended the Sunday evenings of my dear old
friend, Louise Chandler Moulton, the author of <i>Swallow
Flights</i>, at Boston. Her house was the centre of literary
society there. She knew every one who was worth knowing
in literary circles in England and America, and she had a
passion for collecting them on Sunday nights.</p>

<p class='c016'>There I learnt the essential simplicity and common-sensibleness
of American entertainments. No one went
for the refreshments; there were none except coffee and
various kinds of cakes. It was, in fact, afternoon tea,
with coffee instead of the drink which cheers without inebriating,
held at 9 p.m. instead of 5. Her evenings were
crowded.</p>

<p class='c016'>When I went to New York I found the New York literary
people collected every Sunday night in the hospitable home
of Edmund Clarence Stedman, the chief literary biographer
of his day. Laurence Hutton, too, the author of <i>Literary
Landmarks in London</i>, and editor of certain pages of <i>Harper’s
Magazine</i>, had a few people on Sunday nights. There was
always the same simplicity about eating and drinking, and
the same absence of any entertainment, except being introduced
to American celebrities, or occasionally listening
spellbound while one of them told a humorous story in the
inimitable American way.</p>

<p class='c016'>Charles de Kay, the chief art critic in New York of that
day, was one of the few people who gave big afternoon teas
in the English style. De Kay belonged to one of the oldest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>literary families in New York, for he was the grandson of
Joseph Rodman Drake.</p>

<p class='c016'>These were the private literary at-homes. They
yielded in importance to the story-tellers’ nights of the
various clubs, generally Saturday nights. Sometimes there
was a large house dinner at the Club, sometimes nothing
happened until the reception began, about nine, but in any
case, the procedure was the same. First of all, the most
brilliant men of the day told anecdotes, and then the assemblage
broke up into small groups, when the introduction of
strangers to each other was the feature of the evening. It
was in this way that I came to know nearly every important
American writer of that day. Sometimes two good anecdote-tellers
would be put up to banter each other, and the encounters
would be very witty. I remember one encounter
in particular between a Bostonian and a professor of the
University of Chicago. The professor alluded most feelingly
to the departed glories of Boston—Boston which considered
itself the hub of the universe—and dilated upon the new era
which was dawning for Chicago. The Bostonian got up and
agreed with every word he said.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I am surprised at my friend’s agreeing with this,” said
the professor.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Not at all,” said the Bostonian. “I speak as one of the
owners of Chicago.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The audience rocked with laughter, recalling the fact that
this Bostonian had turned a respectable fortune into millions
by buying up a large area in Chicago when it was ruined by
the great fire.</p>

<p class='c016'>At another such evening Mark Twain said the circumstance
which gave him the greatest satisfaction in his life was the
fact that Darwin, for a year before his death, read nothing
but his works. Darwin’s doctors, he added, had warned him
that he would get softening of the brain if he read anything
but absolute drivel.</p>

<p class='c016'>Sometimes there were discussions at these evenings, and
one of them was about the merits of a certain Society poetess,
whose poems enjoyed an unbounded sale without meeting
with the approbation of the critics. “Do you not admit,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>asked one of the lady’s admirers of the editor of the <i>Century
Magazine</i>, “that Miss Van —— is the poetess of passion?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yes,” said the editor, “Miss Van —— is the poetess of
passion—of boarding-house passion.”</p>

<p class='c016'>I never came away from one of these evenings without
feeling that I had been partaking of intellectual champagne.</p>

<p class='c016'>When I was in America Eugene Field edited one of the
great Chicago dailies, and was the principal author of the
West. My first meeting with him was a characteristic one.
I was at an at-home in New York, talking to the editress
of a fashion paper, who had also written books of twaddly
gush about travel. The hostess brought up Field, and
introduced him to the editress.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Very glad to meet you, ma’am,” he said. “I think I
may say that I have read all your books with the greatest
interest.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Are you a writer, Mr. Field?” she asked. “I am sorry
to say that I have never heard of you.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Nor I you, ma’am; but you might have pretended, same
as I did.”</p>

<p class='c016'>There used to be very large at-homes every Sunday
night at the flat of a wealthy old lady who owned an important
newspaper. Her guests were mostly authors and
artists, and she hardly knew any of them by sight, and never
gave any of them commissions to work for her paper. Sometimes
she did not even put in an appearance at her at-homes,
which went on just the same, as if she had been
there. Her guests came to meet each other, not her. She
was not at all literary; her only ambition was like Queen
Elizabeth’s—to be taken for a young and beautiful woman.
She was no longer either, but she dressed the part. Young
America used openly to make fun of her weakness on these
occasions, and I well remember the editor of <i>Puck</i> (a New
York comic paper), to whom she was showing a beautiful
copy of Canova’s nude statue of Napoleon’s sister, Pauline
Borghese, gravely pretending that he thought it was a statue
of herself, and complimenting her on the likeness which the
sculptor had achieved. His impudence carried him through;
his delighted hostess believed that he believed it, and explained,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>with genuine colour coming into her rouged cheeks,
that in spite of the likeness, it was not her, but “Princess
Pauline.”</p>

<p class='c016'>As the refreshments at this house were on a very liberal
scale, it was a good place to meet the section of the Press
which is not satisfied with a mere feast of reason and flow
of soul. One also met fame-hunters, like the sculptor whom
I will call Vermont, who came to cultivate the Press. I was
introduced to him at this house, and I hoped that I should
never see him again, because he was such a colossal egotist.
One day, a few years afterwards, to my dismay, I met him
in Fleet Street. I said, “How do you do, Mr. Vermont?”</p>

<p class='c016'>He said at once, “Can you do something for me?” which
was his invariable habit.</p>

<p class='c016'>I said “yes” cheerfully, meaning to wriggle out of it, for
I did not want to do it. I was under no obligation to him,
because I had been careful not to give him the opportunity
of offering me any hospitalities while I was over there. He
said, “I have never been in England before. Can you tell
me if I ought to use a letter-writer?”</p>

<p class='c016'>I said, “I think so; what is it—a new kind of typewriter?”</p>

<p class='c016'>He said, “No, it is a book which tells you the proper ways
for writing letters.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Remembering that the last letter I had received from him
began, “Mr. Douglas Sladen, Esq., Dear Sir,” I said I thought
he ought, and as we were in Fleet Street, recommended him
to go to Hatchard’s in Piccadilly. I was interested to know
the kind of impression he would make on Arthur Humphreys,
to whom I sent him with my card. I carefully gave him a
card without an address in the hope that I should not see
him any more. But he got my address from Humphreys,
and came to see me the next day. It appeared that he had
brought a large group of statuary with him, which he wished
to present to the City of London. Could I help him in this?
he wished to know. I said yes. I gave him an introduction
to the Lord Mayor, and to the editor of the <i>Illustrated London
News</i>, to both of whom I was a total stranger. He went
away very pleased with himself. The next time I met him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>was at the Lord Mayor’s Day banquet at the Mansion House.
I asked him how he had got on, and he said that he owed
more to me than any one he had ever met. The Lord Mayor
had accepted the sculpture, and given orders for it to be
erected somewhere in the Guildhall Library until its final
position could be decided on, and the editor of the <i>Illustrated
London News</i> was going to give the front page of his next
number to a reproduction of the immortal work. After this
I met him at every important function to which I received
an invitation.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <br /><span class='c022'>WE START OUR LITERARY AT-HOMES IN LONDON</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>I was</span> well known at authors’ clubs and authors’ receptions
long before I was known as an author. In fact, I doubt if
many of those who swarmed to our at-homes ever thought
of me seriously as an author, or even realised that I wrote.
They knew of me as the friend of authors, artists, and actors,
and people who were merely charming, and well enough off
to entertain, and enjoyed meeting the celebrities of Bohemia.
They credited me with a certain capacity as a host, who
always introduced the right people to each other.</p>

<p class='c016'>I had graduated in a good school for entertaining at Boston
and New York, where the hostess takes care that each of
her guests before they leave shall have been introduced to
the persons most worth meeting. If Oliver Wendell Holmes
was in the room at Boston or the American Cambridge, every
guest was presented to him. At a large literary at-home in
New York you were sure to have been introduced to a Mark
Twain, or a Howells, or a Stockton before you left. Americans
make a point of having a guest of honour at an at-home, and
I tried to keep this up as a feature of our at-homes at Addison
Mansions.</p>

<p class='c016'>It was some time before we were able to start our Bohemian
at-homes in London, because when we arrived we had hardly
a single acquaintance in Bohemia, except Gleeson White,
and <i>his</i> author, artist and actor friends, like ours, were all
in America. Like ourselves, he had been three years absent
from England.</p>

<p class='c016'>The hundreds of English and American authors, artists
and actors who knew us at 32, Addison Mansions will recollect
chiefly a very narrow hall hung with autographed portraits
of celebrities, a room whose woodwork and draperies suggested
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>one of the old Mameluke houses at Cairo, a room whose
walls were covered with Japanese curios, and two other
rooms, one of which was lined to the height of several feet
from the ground with ingeniously-fitted-in book-cases, and
the other was a bedroom in disguise. These and a ten by
seven telephone room, likewise lined with book-shelves,
which only had enough chairs for a <i>tête-à-tête</i>, formed the
suite in which we held the weekly receptions in the American
style at which so many people, now famous, used to meet
every Friday night, regaled only with cigarettes, whiskeys-and-sodas,
claret cup, bottled ale and sandwiches.</p>

<p class='c016'>There must have been some attractions about them when
actors like the Grossmiths, and authors like Anthony Hope,
and half-a-dozen R.A.s used to find their way out to these
wilds of West Kensington Friday after Friday towards midnight.
Perhaps it was that we never had any entertainment
when we could help it, and friends were able to make our flat
a rendezvous where they could be secure of having conversations
uninterrupted by music, and to which they could bring
a stranger whom they wished to introduce into Bohemia.</p>

<p class='c016'>Occasionally a stranger so introduced, who happened to
be a famous reciter, felt constrained, as a matter of returning
hospitality, to insist on reciting for us. But in the main, as
a large number of our guests were performers, they were glad
that no performances were allowed, for if they had had to
listen to other people, they would have felt bound, as a
matter of professional etiquette, to perform themselves. If
there are performances and you are a performer, it is a
reproach not to be asked to perform.</p>

<p class='c016'>It was Kernahan who first took us to the Idler Teas.</p>

<p class='c016'>With Sir Walter Besant I had been in correspondence
before I left England, and on my return he wrote asking me
to join the Authors’ Club, with which my name was so
intimately associated for many years. But I did not meet
so many Bohemians there as I did at the Idler Teas and the
dinners of the Vagabonds Club, of which I became a member
because the circle of brilliant young authors whom Jerome
and Barr had enlisted for the <i>Idler Magazine</i> were many of
them “Vagabonds.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>At the Idlers and Vagabonds I met most of the rising
authors, and when the American rush to London commenced,
I took many distinguished Americans to the Idler
Teas, and to the receptions of people whom we met there.
In this way we soon had a very large acquaintance in Bohemia,
eager to meet our American friends, when we commenced
our at-homes on a modest scale to give our literary acquaintances
from the opposite sides of the Atlantic the opportunity
of meeting each other.</p>

<p class='c016'>I met many authors as well as actors at the Garrick and
the Savage—in addition to the authors I met at the Authors’
Club and the Savile, and as I was at that time a member of
the Arts, and the Hogarth, a very lively place, I met a great
many artists. Of black-and-white artists, at any rate, who
patronised the latter, I soon knew quite a number—Phil
May, Bernard Partridge, Dudley Hardy, Reginald Cleaver,
Ralph Cleaver, Hal Hurst, Melton Prior, Seppings Wright,
Holland Tringham, Paxton, James Greig, John Gülich, Louis
Baumer, F. H. Townsend, Fred Pegram, Chantrey Corbould,
Frank Richards, Bernard Gribble, Will Rothenstein, Aubrey
Beardsley, Willson, Starr Wood and Linley Samborne.</p>

<p class='c016'>At the same time we saw a good deal of such well-known
painters as David Murray, R.A.; Solomon J. Solomon, R.A.;
Arthur Hacker, R.A.; J. J. Shannon, R.A.; Walter Crane;
Llewellyn, the P.R.I.; Sir James Linton, P.R.I.; G. A. Storey,
A.R.A.; Sir Alfred East, R.A.; R. W. Allan; J. H. Lorimer,
R.S.A.; J. Lavery; Herbert Schmalz; Hugh de Trafford
Glazebrook; Yeend King; William Yeames, R.A., who married
my cousin, Annie Wynfield; and Alfred Parsons, A.R.A.</p>

<p class='c016'>Various ladies’ clubs, and clubs to which both sexes were
admitted, contributed not a little to the extraordinary
amount of social intercourse which then was a feature of
Bohemia. The Pioneer Club, the Writers’ Club, and the
Women Journalists’ were, frankly, associations of working
women. And there were many members interested in
literature in the Albemarle and the Sesame, ladies’ clubs which
admitted men as guests. Once a week at the Writers’ Club,
and very often at the Pioneer, they had large gatherings at
which literary “shop” filled the air.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Thus in a short time we came to know hundreds of authors
and artists (male and female), actors and actresses, and kept
open house for them every Friday night.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Pioneer, the forerunner of the Lyceum, was a great
institution in those days. Rich women, interested in woman’s
work, established it and bore some of its expense for the
benefit of women workers. It had a fair sprinkling of well-known
authoresses, and the prominent women in all sorts of
movements. Its afternoon and evening receptions—the
latter generally for lectures—were most interesting affairs.
There was no suffragist movement in those days to overshadow
everything else. Women’s Rights were a joke like
“bloomers,” which are now suggestive of something very
different.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Writers’ Club was more frankly literary, more frankly
“shop.” You met non-writing workers too in those basement
premises in Norfolk Street, which have seen the birth
of so many reputations. I remember meeting there a
suffragist whose name is known all over the world now, but
when I was introduced to her it was only known to her fellow-workers.
She asked me what I thought of the suffragists.
Not knowing who she was, and not having thought anything
about them, I replied, “Oh, I’ve nothing against them
except their portraits in the halfpenny papers!” It made
her my friend, for she had suffered from rapid newspaper
reproduction that very morning.</p>

<p class='c016'>I always enjoyed those gatherings of women workers very
much, though many of them had ideas for the betterment
of England which involved the destruction of all I cherished
most, and some were terrifying in their earnestness like the
she-Apostle of antivivisection, who had a hydrophobic glitter
in her eye, which reminded me of a blue-eyed collie I once
had, but had to give away because it bit.</p>

<p class='c016'>This lady was the cause of my gradually dropping away
from those pleasant receptions. It was no good going to
them because no sooner had I been introduced to anybody
interesting, than she came up and wanted me to start enlisting
them for the cause, though I knew that I should never employ
an antivivisectionist doctor in the case of a serious illness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>any more than I should employ a homœopathist. She afterwards
became an <i>advocatus diaboli</i>—an apologist for the
outrages of the Militants, which she said were necessary to
draw attention to the wrongs of women.</p>

<p class='c016'>In after days, when I had written a novel which became
very popular (<i>A Japanese Marriage</i>), I was asked to lecture
before the Pioneer Club on some subject connected with the
book. Noticing that their lectures were generally rather of
an abstract nature, and not having at all an abstract mind
myself, I chose for my subject, “The Immorality of Self-Sacrifice.”
The book was largely taken up with the unhappiness
inflicted on the hero and the heroine because she
was a good churchwoman, and his deceased wife’s sister,
and would not marry him, though she was desperately in
love with him, until long afterwards she was disgusted with
the narrow-mindedness of a clergyman cousin.</p>

<p class='c016'>I gave that lecture in the innocence of my heart. I
imagined that the Club would be so anxious to pioneer for
the Deceased Wife’s Sister Bill, that I should carry the
audience with me. I made the mistake of being too abstract.
If I had contented myself with being “agin’ the Government”
and delivered a technical diatribe in favour of the
Bill, ladies with a mission on this particular subject would
have started up on every side.</p>

<p class='c016'>As it was, speaker after speaker found my idea immoral.
Self-sacrifice was the order of the day; they preached self-sacrifice;
they plumed themselves upon self-sacrifice. They
did not approve of me at all. But what I objected to because
it was self-sacrifice, they objected to because they were
rebels, so the evening went off very well.</p>

<p class='c016'>Bohemian Club evenings in those days differed from those
of the present day because most of them were confined to
men. The Playgoers’ Club was almost the only one which
admitted ladies; and at that time it confined them mostly
to lectures. The ladies’ Clubs certainly welcomed men, but
the serious element was more conspicuous there. The idea
of having a literary club at which ladies and gentlemen
constantly dined together for pleasure had not been born.</p>

<p class='c016'>The actors and actresses and well-known speakers of our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>acquaintance we met mostly at the old Playgoers’ Club, or
at Phil May’s Sunday nights in the stable which had become
his studio.</p>

<p class='c016'>The old Playgoers’ was a most breezy place, where no one
was allowed to speak for more than a few minutes, unless
he could bring down the house with his wit. The ordinary
person making a good sound speech was howled down. The
chairman sometimes interfered to save a more distinguished
orator. I remember the chairman of the club saying at one
of the Christmas dinners to the section in the audience who
were far enough away from the speaker to be talking quite
as loud as he was, “Will those bounders at the back of the
room shut up?”</p>

<p class='c016'>The women writers very appropriately established themselves
as a Writers’ Club in the area flat underneath A. P.
Watt’s literary agency. There was no connection, but I
suppose it resulted in an illustrious man author occasionally
coming on from Watt’s to have a cup of tea at the Writers’
Club. They had an at-home every Friday afternoon, which
was always extremely well supported.</p>

<p class='c016'>I enjoyed going to these Writers’ Club teas very much,
and went often, and on one or other occasion met most of the
leading women workers of the day.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Writers’ Clubbists did not take women’s theories so
seriously as the Pioneers, perhaps because they were not
subsidised, and had no fierce patron to keep them at concert
pitch, but they were more literary, and, until the rise of the
Women Journalists’, had almost the monopoly of working
women writers. The Sesame had some, and when it was
founded later on, the Lyceum became a regular haunt of
them.</p>

<p class='c016'>It was only in our last days at Addison Mansions that we
joined the Dilettanti, a dining club of authors and artists,
run by Paternoster and his charming wife. It has only a
few score members, who once a month eat an Italian dinner
together, washed down by old Chianti, at the Florence
Restaurant in Soho, and listen to a brilliant paper by one of
their members, which they afterwards discuss, with a great
deal of wit and freedom. Henry Baerlein, Mrs. George
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Cran, and Herbert Alexander, are among its wittiest
members, and Mrs. Adam, daughter of Mrs. C. E. Humphry,
the ever-popular “Madge,” is quite the best serious
speaker. The speaking is more really impromptu than at
the Omar Khayyam, for the papers generally have titles which
do not convey the least inkling of what they are to be about,
and it is therefore impossible for people to prepare their
speeches beforehand.</p>

<p class='c016'>Literary at-homes were a great feature of that day. There
was a large set of Literary, Art and Theatrical people who
used to meet constantly at the houses of Phil May, A. L.
Baldry, A. S. Boyd, Moncure D. Conway, Gleeson White,
Dr. Todhunter, William Sharp, Zangwill, Rudolph Lehmann,
E. J. Horniman, Joseph Hatton, Max O’Rell, John Strange
Winter, George and Weedon Grossmith, Mrs. Alec Tweedie,
J. J. Shannon, Mrs. Jopling, and Jerome K. Jerome. And
the more eminent authors and artists, at any rate, used to
meet a great deal at Lady St. Helier’s, Lady Lindsay’s, Lady
Dorothy Nevill’s, the Tennants’ and the H. D. Traills’.</p>

<p class='c016'>Sometimes they met in the afternoon, and sometimes in
the evening—more often the latter, because the artists came
in greater numbers, and the actors, when the Theatres were
closed. As I have said, there were very seldom performances
at any of them, because the people met to talk, and be introduced
to fresh celebrities, and whether the reception was in
the afternoon or the evening, the hospitalities were of the
simple American kind. They were <i>bona fide</i> meetings of
clever people who wished to make each other’s acquaintance.
Our friends came to us on Friday nights. At first, like Phil
May, we kept open house every week, but as the number of
our friends increased, we gradually tailed off to once a fortnight
and once a month, because we had almost to empty
the house out of the windows to make room for all who
came.</p>

<p class='c016'>When we ceased to receive every week, we sent out notices
to the friends we wanted to see most that we were going to
be at home on such an evening, and from this we passed to
giving each at-home in honour of some special person, whom
our friends were invited to meet. I cannot remember half
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>the special guests they were invited to meet, but among
them were Conan Doyle, Anthony Hope, Mark Twain, Mrs.
Flora Annie Steel, Mrs. Frances Hodgson Burnett, Maarten
Maartens, Hall Caine, H. G. Wells, W. W. Jacobs, Sir
Frederick Lugard (then Captain Lugard) when he came back
from his great work in Uganda, F. C. Selous when he came
back from his mighty hunting in South Africa, Zangwill,
J. J. Shannon, Frankfort Moore, Savage Landor and Dr.
George Ernest Morrison.</p>

<p class='c016'>In a very short time, Bohemian at-homes, at which author
and artist and actor met, became the rage in the Bohemian
quarters of London—West Kensington, Chelsea, Chiswick,
and the North-west. There were many people who were
never so happy as when they went to an at-home every afternoon
and evening of the week. They were all workers, and
most of them too poor to use cabs much, so one wondered
when they found time to do their work. That they did it
was obvious, for most of them were producing a good deal of
work, and many of them were laying the foundations of not
inconsiderable fame.</p>

<p class='c016'>At some of these receptions they had a little music, but at
most of them they had no entertainment. For the clever
people who went to these receptions did not go long distances
to sit like mutes while some third- or fourth- or fortieth-rate
artist played or sang; they went to meet other well-known
Bohemians—well-known men and charming women. The
most successful hosts were those who asked celebrities and
pretty people in equal quantities: the celebrities liked
meeting pretty people, and the pretty people liked meeting
the celebrities.</p>

<p class='c016'>Some celebrities were quite annoyed if there were only
celebrities to meet them; they wanted an audience.</p>

<p class='c016'>I remember Whistler the painter and Oscar Wilde being
the first two people to arrive at a reception at Mrs. Jopling’s
house in Beaufort Street, where I had been lunching. They
were intensely annoyed at having only the Joplings and myself
as audience; it was no good showing off before us, since we
knew all about them. They were quite distant to each other,
and more distant to us. But as the time wore on, and nobody
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>came, Wilde had time to think of something effective to say—he
never spoke, if he could help it, unless he thought he could
be effective.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I hear that you went over to the Salon by Dieppe,
Jimmy,” he sneered, “were you economising?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Don’t be foolish,” said Whistler. “I went to paint.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“How many pictures did you paint?” asked the æsthete,
with crushing superiority.</p>

<p class='c016'>Whistler did not appear to hear his question. “How many
hours did it take?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You went, not I,” said Oscar. “No gentleman ever goes
by the Dieppe route.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I do, often,” said our charming hostess, who had this
great house in Chelsea, with an acre or two of garden: “it
takes five hours.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“How many minutes are there in an hour, Oscar?”
drawled Whistler.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I am not quite sure, but I think it’s about sixty. I am
not a mathematician.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Then I must have painted three hundred,” said the
unabashed Whistler.</p>

<p class='c016'>It was at this at-home later on that Whistler made his
often-quoted mot—not for the first time, I believe. A pretty
woman said something clever, and Wilde, who could be a
courtier, gallantly remarked that he wished he had said it.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Never mind, Oscar,” said Whistler, who owed him one
for the gibe about the Dieppe route; “you will have said it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>They were really very fine that afternoon, because they
were so thoroughly disgusted at not having more people to
show off before; showing off is a weakness of many authors
and artists and actors, though Bernard Shaw is the only one
that I remember who has had the frankness to admit it in
<i>Who’s Who</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>We used to begin receiving at nine for the sake of people
who had trains to catch to distant suburbs—as Jerome
K. Jerome remarked, “other people always live in such
out-of-the-way places”—and kept the house open till the
last person condescended to go away, which was generally
about three. Any one who had been introduced to us was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>welcome to come, and to bring any of his friends with him,
and in this way we met some of the most interesting people
who came to the flat during our twenty years of tenancy.
For instance, Herbert Bunning, the composer, whose opera
<i>La Princesse Osra</i>, presented at Covent Garden, was
drawn from Anthony Hope’s novel by a permission which I
obtained for him, brought with him one night M. Feuillerat,
who married Paul Bourget’s delightful sister, and Madame
Feuillerat. M. Feuillerat in his turn brought with him Emile
Verhaeren, one of the greatest living Belgian poets. M.
Feuillerat himself was at the time professor of English
literature in the university at Rennes, and both he and
Madame Feuillerat spoke admirable English. On another
Friday they were going to bring Paul Bourget himself, but
he did not fulfil his intention of coming to England at the
time.</p>

<p class='c016'>Another distinguished foreigner who came about the same
time was Maarten Maartens, a Dutch country gentleman
whose real name is Joost Marius Maarten Willem van der
Poorten-Schwartz. Hearing so much of his beautiful chateau
in Holland, I asked him how he could tear himself away so
much as he did. His reply was that for nine months in the
year the weather in Holland was awful, and for the other
three generally awful. This great writer had an epigrammatic
way of expressing himself. He said that an eminent
critic, who constituted himself his patron when he was in
England, had warned him not to go to the Authors’ Club
(of which I was the Honorary Secretary), because most of
the people who went there were very small fry. He said
that he had taken no notice of the warning because he had
observed that his informant wore a piece of pink sarcenet
ribbon for a tie, and that he, Maarten Maartens, knew enough
of the Englishman’s idea of dress to be aware that the critic
could not be a judge of ties, and wear pink sarcenet ribbon;
and he argued that a man so self-satisfied and so ignorant
about ties might be equally self-satisfied and ignorant
about Authors’ clubs. I asked him if he had written any
books in Dutch. He said, “No, what is the good, when
there are so few people to write for? Only Dutchmen speak
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>Dutch. It was a choice of writing in English or German,
if I was to have an audience, and I chose English.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Georg Brandes, the great Danish critic, who had so much
to do with the recognition of Ibsen, told me when he came
to our flat and I asked him a similar question, that in his
later books he had taken to writing in other languages for the
same reason. He was extremely interested, I remember, in
Sergius Stepniak, the exiled Russian revolutionary, as was
the then permanent head of the Foreign Office, whom I
approached with some diffidence on the subject when they
were both dining at a Club dinner of which I had the arrangements.
Stepniak, whom I always found, in my intercourse
with him, a very amiable man, had all the stage appearance of
a villain, with his coal-black hair, his knotty, bulbous forehead,
his black Tartar eyes, black beard and sombre complexion.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of Zola, a studious-looking man with a brown beard, a
rather tilted nose, and pince-nez, I have spoken in another
chapter.</p>

<p class='c016'>Anatole France I never met till quite recently, at a little
party at John Lane’s. He was as abounding in <i>simpatica</i>
as Zola was wanting in it. He was rather short, and held his
head sideways like the late Conte de Paris, with his closely-cropped
beard buried in his chest. But he had unmistakably
the air of a great man, and extraordinarily bright and
sympathetic eyes—a captivating personality.</p>

<p class='c016'>As I began with foreigners I will deal with them before
passing on to the many interesting Anglo-Saxons who
assembled in those rooms during those twenty years.</p>

<p class='c016'>August Strindberg, the Scandinavian novelist and
dramatist, was to have come to see us when he was in England
in the ’nineties. He forwarded an introduction, but did
not follow it up owing to the distance of his sojourning place.
Before he left Scandinavia, he had asked a friend who was
supposed to know all about England for a nice healthy
suburb of London, far enough out for the air to be pure.
The friend suggested (without, I think, any idea of practical
joking) that Gravesend should be the place, and at Gravesend
Strindberg remained during the whole of his stay in London,
doubtless composing novels or dramas upon London society.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Many well-known Frenchmen naturally came to see us,
like Gabriel Nicolet, the artist, and Eustache de Lorey, who
had been an attaché of the French Legation in Teheran,
and who afterwards collaborated with me in <i>Queer Things
about Persia</i> and <i>The Moon of the Fourteenth Night</i>. Since
his return from Persia he had become eminent as a composer.
He wrote the music of one of the most popular
songs in <i>Les Merveilleuses</i>, in addition to being the composer
of the opera <i>Betty</i>, which was produced in Brussels,
with Mariette Sully in the leading part. Melba herself contemplates
appearing in the leading rôle in his second opera,
<i>Leila</i>. De Lorey had made some most adventurous
expeditions, including one with Pierre Loti in Caucasia, and
he was such a brilliant raconteur of his adventures that I
asked him why he did not make a book of them. He replied
that the travel-book is not the institution in France which
it is in England, and that though he spoke English fluently,
he could not write a book in English. Finally we decided
to collaborate as related in a later chapter.</p>

<p class='c016'>We had many Asiatic visitors, but no Africans, I think,
unless one counts Englishmen who had won their spurs in
the dark continent, like Sir Frederick Lugard. Decidedly
our most interesting Asiatic visitors were Japanese like
Yoshio Markino and Prof. Nakamura. Prof. Nakamura
was for three years a pupil of Lafcadio Hearn. He came
over to England for the Japanese Exhibition, and remained
here a few years, studying educational methods for the
Japanese Government.</p>

<p class='c016'>He said that Lafcadio Hearn would see nothing of his
pupils because he was only interested in the Old Japan, and
was afraid of introducing modern ideas if he saw much of
any Japanese who were not absorbed in the same studies as
himself. I remember Bret Harte pleading much the same
objection to revisiting California.</p>

<p class='c016'>Yoshio Markino has been one of our most intimate friends
for years. I cannot say in what exact year he first came to
32 Addison Mansions. I know that I first met him through
M. H. Spielmann, who wrote to me telling me all about Markino’s
powers as a black-and-white artist, and asking me to get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>my editor friends to give him some work, of which he stood in
need. Not until he published <i>A Japanese Artist in London</i>
at my suggestion, and with a preface written by me, a few
years after, did I know how badly he stood in need of that
work; Japanese etiquette prevented him from intruding
his private affairs upon a stranger. I was successful in
getting him a little illustrating work, and I got him some
translating work, better paid, I suspect, than original contributions
of men like the late Andrew Lang to the great
<i>Dailies</i>. It came about in this wise: I was anxious to
include in <i>More Queer Things about Japan</i>, a translation
of a Japanese life of Napoleon, which had come into my
hands. There were five volumes of it with extremely amusing
illustrations. Neither I nor the publishers knew what a
small amount of words can make a volume in Japanese.
The publisher looked at the volumes and thought that he
was making a very shrewd bargain when he offered five
pounds a volume as the translator’s fee. Each volume
proved to contain about a thousand words, so Markino got
five pounds a thousand, when the publisher meant to offer
him about five shillings.</p>

<p class='c016'>After this I lost touch of Markino for a long time, till Miss
E. S. Stevens, who had been my secretary, and was then
doing work as a literary agent, invited us to meet him at
her Club. Very soon after that I was at the annual soirée
of the Japan Society with Miss Lorimer and another girl,
and my cousin, Sampson Sladen, who was then only third
in command of the London Fire Brigade, when we ran across
Markino, who remained with us all the evening. He invited
myself and the members of our household to the exhibition
of the sketches which he had painted to illustrate <i>The Colour
of London</i>. From that time forward his visits were very
frequent till we left London, and on two separate occasions
he went to Italy with us for several months.</p>

<p class='c016'>It was on the first of these occasions, while we were all
staying at 12 Piazza Barberini in Rome, that he showed me
a letter which he had written to Messrs. Chatto &amp; Windus
about the second of the volumes he illustrated, <i>The Colour of
Paris</i>. The letter was as brilliant, as interesting, as amusing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>as one of Robert Louis Stevenson’s or Lafcadio Hearn’s.
I saw that he was a born writer, and from that time forward
did not rest until I had persuaded him to write his first book,
<i>A Japanese Artist in London</i>. I got him the contract from
the publisher for this book and wrote the preface.</p>

<p class='c016'>While we were in Paris he brought us an invitation to
dinner from the brilliant Parisian who was afterwards our
dear friend, poor Yvonne, who died the other day after
months of suffering. When we arrived she had a terrible
headache, and we had to have our dinner without her, presided
over by her niece, a gay and pretty child of thirteen,
who made as self-possessed a hostess as any grown-up. We
talked a great deal that night over Italy, and a great deal
more when Markino came to see us at the little Cité de Retiro,
near the Madeleine, and the result was that he decided to
do a book on Italy with Miss Olave Potter, he supplying the
pictures, and she the letterpress—the book that took form
as <i>The Colour of Rome</i>, which Messrs. Chatto &amp; Windus
promptly agreed to commission, and of which I shall have
more to say elsewhere. That winter and the summer of
another year we all spent together in Italy, and the painting
of the illustrations for <i>The Colour of Rome</i> led indirectly to
Markino’s writing <i>A Japanese Artist in London</i>, and the
beginning of his brilliant literary career.</p>

<p class='c016'>Markino’s writings achieved such an instant popularity
with English readers that I feel sure that they will like to
know his habits of work, which I had the opportunity of
observing during the two long visits he paid with us to
Italy. For a painter of architecture and landscape his
method is unique. Take, for instance, the story of the
illustrations to Miss Olave Potter’s book, <i>The Colour of Rome</i>.
First of all, since he was a stranger to Rome, and knew
neither its beauty spots nor its most interesting monuments,
we took him walks to see all the most illustrable places.
He selected from them the number he had promised to paint.
Sometimes he took more than one walk to a place before he
commenced the study for his picture, but intuition is one of
his gifts, and he was seldom long at fault in discovering the
best standpoint.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Having chosen this, he took his drawing-pad to the spot
and made a rough sketch of it with notes written in Japanese
of the colours to be used, and any special things he had to
remember. Sometimes, where there was a great deal of
detail, or of sculpture, he used paper with crossed lines on
it, so as to preserve his proportions. But Markino, beautifully
as he can paint detail, resents it, and prefers subjects
unified by a haze of heat or mist.</p>

<p class='c016'>He never took his paints out with him, and never did a
finished drawing in the open air. He took his notes home
with him and ruminated over them, till the idealised picture
presented itself to his brain. Then he set to work on it,
taking little rest till it was finished—always absolutely
faithful to colour and effect, though the picture was painted
entirely indoors.</p>

<p class='c016'>That was his method of painting. He did no writing in
Rome. But he came constantly to our flat when he was
writing <i>A Japanese Artist in London</i>, <i>My Idealled John
Bullesses</i>, and <i>When I was a Child</i>. Sometimes he liked to
talk over his chapters before he began to write them, when
they were slow at taking shape. But more generally he
brought the chapters written in the rough to his Egeria, and
read them over to her. They had blanks where he could not
remember the English word which he wanted to use. It was
in his mind, and he would reject all words till he found the
word he was thinking of.</p>

<p class='c016'>As he read the chapters aloud, the wise Egeria made
corrections where they were necessary to elucidate his
meaning—to clarify his style, but never treated any Japanese
use of English as a mistake, unless it made the sense obscure.
That is how the fascinating medium in which Markino writes
took shape.</p>

<p class='c016'>Take, for instance, Markino’s omission of the <i>articles</i>.
The Japanese language has no articles. Markino therefore
seldom uses them, and his English is written to be intelligible
without them, just as a legal document is written to be
intelligible without punctuation. Again, if he used a word
in a palpably wrong sense—<i>i. e.</i> with a meaning which it
had never borne before, or was etymologically unfit to bear—she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>left it if it helped to express in a forcible way what
he intended.</p>

<p class='c016'>The result of this respectful editing was to produce a most
fascinating and characteristic type of English, which has
won for Markino a public of enthusiastic admirers. He has,
as Osman Edwards said, <i>the heart of a child</i>, when he is
writing, and he combines with it a highly original mode of
thinking and expressing himself, but their effect would have
been half lost if he had not found in his Egeria an adviser
with the eye of genius for what should be corrected and
what should be retained of his departures from conventional
English.</p>

<p class='c016'>When the chapters were corrected thus, Egeria typed
them out, making any corrections or additions which were
necessary to the punctuation, and generally preparing the
manuscript for the press.</p>

<p class='c016'>I am encouraged to think that these details of the way
in which the books were edited will interest the public,
because J. H. Taylor, the golf champion, once cross-examined
me on the subject, as we were walking down the lane from
the Mid-Surrey golf pavilion to his house. He had been
reading <i>A Japanese Artist in London</i>, and was so delighted
with it that he wanted to know exactly how this wonderful
style of writing was born.</p>

<p class='c016'>And there is no doubt that it is a wonderful style of writing.
It is not pigeon-English; the Japanese do not use pigeon-English,
they abhor it. It is the result of a deliberate
intention to apply certain Japanese methods of expression
(like the omission of the article) to the writing of English,
in order to produce a more direct medium, and the result
has been a complete success. Markino’s English is wonderfully
forcible. It hits like a sledge-hammer. He has a
genius for discovering exactly the right expression, and he
thinks on till he discovers it. As a reason why his English
is not broken English, but a medium using the capabilities
of both languages, I may mention that he has been living in
America and England for nearly twenty years.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <br /><span class='c022'>OUR AT-HOMES: THE YOUNG AUTHORS WHO ARE NOW GREAT AUTHORS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Of</span> all the men who used to come to 32, Addison Mansions
from our having met them at the Idler teas, none were more
identified with the success of Jerome’s two periodicals <i>The
Idler</i> and <i>To-day</i> than Arthur Conan Doyle and Israel
Zangwill. Doyle had been writing for ten years before
he achieved commanding success. Be that as it may,
he was undoubtedly the most successful of the younger
authors who were familiar figures in that Vagabond and
Idler set. Doyle, who was the son of that exquisite artist,
Charles Doyle, and grandson of the famous caricaturist
H. B., and nephew of Dicky Doyle of <i>Punch</i>, ought to have
been granted a royaller road to success, for he had enjoyed
a very early connection with literature, having sat as a little
child on the knee of the immortal Thackeray. Thackeray’s
old publishers, Smith, Elder &amp; Co., have been his, but he
had travelled to the Arctic regions and to the tropics and
practised for eight years as a doctor at Southsea before he
charmed the world with his famous novels <i>The White Company</i>
in 1890, and <i>The Refugees</i> in 1891, and astonished it with
the <i>Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</i> in the latter year. He
was a doctor at Norwood when I first made his acquaintance.
He was a little over thirty then, and a keen cricketer,
being nearly county form (indeed, he did actually play once
for Hampshire, and might at one time have played regularly
for Hampshire as an Association back). It was not until
late in life, however, that he found time enough to get much
practise at games. Then for some years he played occasional
first-class cricket, having an average of thirty-two against
Kent, Derbyshire and other good teams; in the last year he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>played for the M.C.C. That was after the war, when he was
over forty. He played a hard Association match in his
forty-fourth year.</p>

<p class='c016'>From an early stage in his literary career he enjoyed
the admiration and the deepest respect of all his fellows in
the craft, and for years past has undoubtedly been morally
the head of the profession. Upon him has fallen the mantle
of Sir Walter Besant. In saying this, I am not instituting
any comparison between the merits of his various lines of
work, which in their own line are quite unexcelled, and
those of the other leading authors, but he is not only
among the handful who may be called the very best authors
of the day, he is the man to whom the profession would
undoubtedly look for a lead in any crisis.</p>

<p class='c016'>Say, for instance, that the idea, so often debated recently,
of authors combining with publishers to fix the price of a
novel at ten and sixpence, and refusing to work for or sell
their goods to any one who would not abide by this decision,
were put to a vote in the literary profession, what Doyle
thought would count most. The profession as an army
would range themselves under his banner. Suppose
a question, like the insurance question which has been
threatening the livelihood of thousands of doctors, were to
arise for authors, they would look to Doyle for a lead. If
the decision which he made benefited authors as a whole, but
cost him half or three-quarters of his income, and a syndicate
approached him with a huge offer to abandon the camp,
nobody could suppose for one moment that Doyle would
listen to them. His moral courage, his loyalty, his generosity,
his patriotism, added to his wonderful literary gifts, have
confered upon him a commanding position. Of his gifts
I shall speak lower down. It is as the patriot that one must
always consider him first. He is not naturally a party man,
though he happens to have contested Edinburgh as a Liberal
Unionist, and the Hawick boroughs as a Tariff Reformer.
There have been moments when he has been openly opposed
to some measure of the Unionist Party. He really belongs
to the Public Service party. He made notable sacrifices
for his country at the time of the Boer War. First he gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>up his literary work to serve unpaid on the staff of the
Langman Field Hospital and afterwards to write the pamphlet
on <i>The Cause and Conduct of the War</i>, an attempt to place
the true facts before the people of Europe, which brought
him nothing but great expense and the undying gratitude
and respect of his fellow-countrymen. That he cares nothing
for popularity where principles are concerned is shown by
the attitude he took over the famous horse-maiming case,
or his acceptance of the Presidency of the Divorce Law
Reform Union.</p>

<div id='i074f'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i074f.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>SIR A. CONAN DOYLE<br /><i>Drawn by Yoshio Markino</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c016'>His sturdy character is reflected in his physique, and there
are few people in London who do not know that unusually
big and strong frame, that round head, with prominent
cheek-bones, and dauntless blue eyes, the bluff, good-humoured
face: for his sonorous voice is frequently heard
from the chair of public meetings where some protest for
the public good has to be raised, or at a dinner-table on the
guest nights of clubs. Sir Arthur, for he was knighted in
1902, is a most popular speaker; hearty, engaging, amusing,
in his lighter moods, most trenchant and convincing in a
crisis, of all the authors of the day he merits most the title
of a great man.</p>

<p class='c016'>The curious thing is that although every one knows how
much he respects Doyle as a great man, and every one is
aware that he is one of the most popular, if not the most
popular, of the authors of the day, not every one has analysed
the soundness of his literary fame. In my opinion, of all very
popular authors, Doyle deserves his popularity as an author
most. No man living has written better historical novels,
judged from the standpoint of eloquence, accuracy or thrill.
Doyle has carried the accuracy of the man of science into all
his studies, and his power to thrill with eloquence and incident
is beyond question. His detective stories are equal to the
best that have ever been written. His history of the South
African War is not only the best history of the war, but it
is a model of contemporary history, always the most difficult
kind to write, because only the eye of intuition can distinguish
respective values amid contemporary incidents.
He has been highly successful as a playwright too. His <i>House</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span><i>of Temperley</i> is the best Prize-Ring play in the language, as
his novel, <i>Rodney Stone</i>, which had no lady-love heroine,
was the best Prize-Ring novel, and his play on Waterloo,
produced by Sir Henry Irving, has become a classic. I have
alluded elsewhere to the dramatisation of his <i>Sherlock Holmes</i>
which has been played thousands of times. Doyle not
only was present at our at-homes at 32 Addison Mansions,
but, living out of town, once stayed with us there, as we
stayed with him at Hindhead on another occasion. But
owing to his living out of town, he was a great deal less
familiar figure at receptions than most of the other younger
authors of the first rank, except Rudyard Kipling and
J. M. Barrie, both of whom cordially hate “functions” of
any kind. Doyle, placed in the same circumstances as they
are, forces himself to go to many functions for which he has
less time than they have, for his literary output is infinitely
greater, and he has so many other duties to perform, and
always performs them.</p>

<p class='c016'>When I asked Doyle what first turned him to writing, he
said—</p>

<p class='c016'>“All the art that is in our family—my grandfather, three
uncles, and father were all artists—ran in my blood, and
took a turn towards letters. At six I was writing stories;
I fancy my mother has them yet. At school I was, though
I say it, a famous story-teller; at both schools I was at I
edited a magazine, and practically wrote the whole of it
also.</p>

<p class='c016'>“When I started studying medicine, the family affairs
were very straitened. My father’s health was bad, and
he earned little. I tried to earn something, which I did by
going out as medical assistant half the year. Then I tried
stories. In 1878, when I was nineteen years old, I sent
<i>The Mystery of the Sassasa Valley</i> to Chambers. I got three
guineas. It was 1880 before I got another accepted. It was
by <i>London Society</i>. From then until 1888 I averaged about
fifty pounds a year, getting about three pounds a story.
My first decent price was twenty-eight pounds from the Cornhill
for <i>Habakuk Jephson’s Statement</i> in 1886. Then at New
Year, 1888, Ward, Lock &amp; Co. brought out <i>A Study in</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span><i>Scarlet</i>, paying twenty-five pounds for all rights. I have
never had another penny from that book; I wonder how
much they have had? Then came <i>Micah Clarke</i> at the end
of 1888, which got me a more solid public. It was not until
1902 that I was strong enough to be able to entirely abandon
medical practice. Of course, it was the Holmes stories in
the <i>Strand</i> which gave me my popular vogue, but <i>The White
Company</i>, which has been through fifty editions, has sold far
more as a book than any of the Holmes books.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Kipling I regard as the genius of the junction of the nineteenth
and twentieth centuries, and England owes an incalculable
debt to his patriotism and eloquence. If Doyle
is the voice of the literary profession, Kipling is the voice of
the country. He speaks for the manhood of England in
a crisis. All through the African War a letter or a poem
from Kipling was the trumpet voice of national feeling.
No poet who has written in English has ever inspired his
countrymen like Kipling. His poems, though they have
not the poetical quality of those of our great standard poets,
have the prophetical quality, which is just as important in
poetry, in a higher degree than any of them. They are
Rembrandt poems, not Raphael poems, and they will remain
without loss of prestige, an armoury for every patriotic or
manful writer and speaker to quote from. I reviewed
Kipling’s poems when they were first published in America
for the leading Canadian paper. I am thankful that I
hailed them as the work of genius, and it was a proud moment
when I first shook hands with him in the early ’nineties.
Though his short stories are the best in the language, I always
think of him as a poet, because he is our <i>vates</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is best to mention Barrie, our other genius, here, though
I have little to say about him. On the rare occasions when
he speaks in public, he speaks admirably, and he enjoys
universal respect. As far as literature is concerned, no
man’s lines have been laid in pleasanter places. Unlike
Doyle, Anthony Hope, Stanley Weyman and others, Barrie
did not have to wait for recognition. It is notorious that
from the very beginning he never had the proverbial manuscript
in the drawer; in other words, that he always found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>an immediate sale for whatever he wrote. He began as a
journalist.</p>

<p class='c016'>Anthony Hope I first met at an Idler tea. He was one
of the brilliant band of younger authors whom Jerome was
among the first to recognise. In those days he kept the
distinction between “Anthony Hope” the writer, and
Anthony Hope Hawkins the barrister, most rigidly. Being
the son of a famous London clergyman, Mr. Hawkins, of St.
Bride’s, Fleet Street, a cousin of Mr. Justice Hawkins, a
scholar of Balliol, and an eloquent speaker, his prospects at
the Bar were very good. There was an idea that they would
suffer if it were known that he indulged in anything so
frivolous as writing love-stories. These were the days when
he was composing his immortal “Dolly Dialogues” for the
<i>Westminster Gazette</i>, and when he was just beginning the
succession of witty and delicate novels which made his fame.
He had, I have always understood, been writing for some
years, before he could make any impression on the public,
and even then he had no hope of making a living by literature.
I made one of his early novels my book of the week in <i>The
Queen</i>, in a most enthusiastic review, and incidentally
mentioned his real name. His friends, perhaps they were
officious, entreated me not to do it again, lest it should
injure his prospects. A year or two afterwards there was
no question off which profession he was to make a living,
though as he coquetted with politics, and contested a constituency
or two, he probably kept up the legal fiction of his
being at the Bar for some time longer.</p>

<p class='c016'>As he had enjoyed the distinction of being President of
the Oxford Union, he was a practised speaker before he
came to London. He had plenty of opportunities of exercising
his skill without waiting for briefs, for he became a
frequent speaker at Club dinners. The charm of his voice
and his delivery, the polish and wit of his speeches were
recognised at once, and his popularity as a speaker has been
undisputed from that day to this.</p>

<p class='c016'>It was noticed that, though he was so brilliant and fluent,
when making a speech, he was rather a silent man at receptions,
except where politeness demanded that he should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>exert himself. But this is a common trait in the more considerable
authors. They are frequently not only rather
silent, but ill at ease. In those days one could count the
authors who were both brilliant socially and brilliant writers,
on one’s fingers.</p>

<p class='c016'>One legal habit Anthony Hope retained; he went to
chambers to do his writing as he had been accustomed,
and lived in other chambers, and was regarded as a confirmed
bachelor till he married. He came to Addison
Mansions very frequently in the ’nineties. The incident I
remember best was his loss of presence of mind when I tried
to save him from a terrific American bore, a middle-aged
lady. Somebody had brought her; I had not met her
before, and she was having a systematic lion-hunt. She
thought that A. H. H. was Anthony Hope, but she was not
certain, and said to me, “Is that <i>Anthony Hope</i>? I must
know <i>Anthony Hope</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Wishing to save him from the infliction, because he was
always rather distrait with bores, I said, “That is Mr.
Hawkins.” I didn’t think she knew enough about literature
to be aware of the identity, nor did she, but he had unfortunately
caught the words “Anthony Hope,” and smiled,
and started forward, and was lost. As he had unconsciously
convicted me of falsehood, I left him to his fate.</p>

<p class='c016'>Generous to needy brother authors, punctilious in the
performance of the duties to the literary profession, which
his eminence confers on him (in such matters as the Authors’
Society and literary clubs), wonderfully patient and courteous,
an admirable literary craftsman, who never turns out slipshod
work, as well as a brilliant romancer and witty dialogist,
Anthony Hope Hawkins deserves every particle of his
popularity and success.</p>

<p class='c016'>I have not dilated on his plays, though he has achieved
great success on the stage, because dramatists tell me that
he is not going to write for it any more.</p>

<p class='c016'>The popularity of our at-homes was at its height before
Frankfort Moore had decided to come over to England,
giving up the editorial post he held in Ireland, to devote all
his time to novel-writing. He and his delightful wife, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>sister of Mrs. Bram Stoker, took lodgings at Kew, and were
ready for many receptions, so that he might meet his fellow-authors
in London. As Bram Stoker had then for years
been Irving’s right hand, they had an excellent introduction
ready-made, but they brought letters of introduction to us,
and, up to the time of his leaving London, he was among
our most intimate literary friends.</p>

<p class='c016'>Frankfort Moore’s success in London was instantaneous,
as well it might have been, since he was a brilliant and witty
speaker, as well as a writer of brilliant, witty and very
charming books. Hutchinson eagerly took up the publication
of his works, and the literary clubs soon learned to
depend upon him as one of the best after-dinner speakers.
In about ten years he made a fortune, and retired to take
things in a more leisurely way at an old house in Sussex,
where he was able to adequately house his fine collection of
old oak, old brass, old engravings and old china, in which he
was a noted connoisseur.</p>

<p class='c016'>His immediate success justified his giving up his lodgings
at Kew, and taking a nice, old-fashioned house in Pembroke
Road, which he soon began to transform with his panelling,
and his collections. His retirement from London left a
great gap in many social circles. He was a universal favourite—a
man of real eminence, although he regarded his achievements
so modestly.</p>

<p class='c016'>One of the most valued of our visitors was the celebrated
Father Stanton, of St. Alban’s, Holborn, who introduced
himself to me when he was on his way to Syracuse with
F. E. Sidney, with whom he went to Seville on that expedition
which resulted in the publication of the latter’s <i>Anglican
Innocents in Spain</i>, the book which aroused such anger
among Roman Catholics. We were the only two occupants
of a sleeping compartment on the Italian railways. He was
not wearing clerical dress, and I had no notion who he was
until the conclusion of our journey, when Sidney, who had
joined us, informed me. We did a lot of sight-seeing in
Syracuse together, especially in the cathedral (built into an
entire Greek temple, ascribed to Pallas Athene). Both
Stanton and Sidney were experts in old gilt, in which Sicily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>is very rich—the organ at Syracuse is an example. From
that time until Stanton’s death we constantly met at the
house of Sidney, who has the best collection of sixteenth-century
stained glass in England, and built a house in Frognal
with the proper windows to receive it. Though Stanton and
I did not agree in Church matters, we were yet staunch
friends, and I was an immense admirer of one who did so
much for the regeneration of the poor in one of the worst
districts of London.</p>

<p class='c016'>The greatest compliment we ever received at our at-homes
was when Lord Dundonald, who had known us for
some years, and had just come back from his famous relief
of Ladysmith with his irregular cavalry, came and spent the
best part of the afternoon with us. He looked worn and very
sunburnt, but it was one of the events of our lifetimes to hear
the stirring details of England’s greatest military drama in
this generation, direct from the lips of the man who had
given it its happy termination.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <br /><span class='c022'>THE HUMORISTS AT OUR AT-HOMES</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Among</span> the crowd of humorists who honoured Addison
Mansions with their presence it is natural to mention first
the famous author of <i>Three Men in a Boat</i>. There is no
author for whom I feel a greater affection, though, as he
once said, “You and I are sure to have a diametrically
opposite opinion upon almost any point which may turn up,
because we were born the poles apart.” I was at the time
his chief and only book critic on <i>To-day</i>. I believe I was
called the literary editor, though all the patronage of the
position was exercised by himself. It is patronage which
constitutes an editor; the sub-editor can perform the duties.
I believe also that it was I who suggested the name <i>To-day</i>.
At any rate, it was I who helped him to formulate the paper,
and for the first year or so it was my duty to do all the
book reviews in it, and my duty to receive all the ladies
who came to see Jerome about the paper. Of course, they
mostly came in search of work or fame: those who wished
to be written about were very numerous, and expected to
succeed by making what is called the “Glad Eye” at him.
He was <i>terribly</i> afraid of the “Glad Eye”; it made him
turn hot and cold in swift succession. He was unable to
say “no” to a siren, and equally unable to say “yes” when
he meant “no.” He was also an intensely domesticated
man, entirely devoted to his family, and without the smallest
desire for a flirtation. So it fell to my lot to pick up the
“Glad Eye,” a very agreeable job, when you have not the
power to give yourself away. I had no patronage to bestow
upon them. The only thing I could do for them was to
write about them if they were sufficiently interesting, which
frequently happened in that age of personal journalism.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>And, if they were quite harmless worshippers, without any
ulterior designs, I occasionally induced Jerome to be worshipped
for a minute or two. I made many lady friends at
this period, especially from the Stage.</p>

<p class='c016'>Jerome hardly ever answered letters. He used to say,
“If you keep a letter for a month, it generally answers
itself.” But he did not keep them. He tore them up directly
he had glanced at them. He knew at one glance—probably
at the signature—if he wanted to read a letter, and, if he
did not, he tore it up without reading it. He had a horror
of accumulating papers. He sometimes asked me to answer
letters, as he had faith in me as a soother. It was never
part of my duties to write “yes,” I had to gild “no.” He
prefered to word his own acceptances, so as not to say
more than he meant. He did not even want me to read the
manuscripts. He prefered to read them himself. It did
not take him long, because if he did not come across something
worth publishing by the second page, he did not read any
further. “You must grab your reader at the beginning,”
he used to say.</p>

<p class='c016'>He was a very pleasant man to write reviews for. He
believed in generous criticisms. “You can have a page or
two pages for your book of the week,” he said, “according
to its importance”—he decided that when I chose my book—“but
you can only have a page for the rest of the books
that come in, so you can’t afford to waste your space on
bad books. If you can’t say anything good about them,
you obviously can’t afford them any space. You can praise
things up as much as you like if you can be convincing about
it: don’t be afraid to let yourself go about the book of the
week: I am sick of the <i>Spectator</i> and the <i>Athenæum</i>, you
never get a full-blooded review out of them, unless it’s to
damn something. The more knowledge you can show about
the subject of the book you are praising, the better. But
above all things, recommend it in the paper just as you would
recommend it to a friend: use the same language as you
would to a friend: be natural. And, whatever you do,
beware of the Club Man. When I read an article or a story,
I always ask myself what a Club Man would think of it;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>and if I know that he would like it, I turn it down: his
opinions are dead opposite to the Public’s.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The likes and dislikes of the Club Man was one of the
matters in which my opinion was dead opposite to Jerome’s.
The Club Man and the Man in the Street between them fill
the ranks of the average patriotic citizen. It is they who
pull the nation through in a crisis, and the City of London
leads them. At ordinary times their voice is drowned by
the noise of the Radical Party, and the giant Middle-class, to
whom all appeals for national safety have to be addressed—the
blind Samson sitting chained in the house of his enemies—cannot
hear their warnings.</p>

<p class='c016'>In any case, it is so hard for a book to be popular at clubs,
where people go to be interested and amused, that if it is
popular there, it will be popular anywhere, except with the
Nonconformist Conscience.</p>

<p class='c016'>Jerome had written <i>Three Men in a Boat</i> and <i>The Idle
Thoughts of an Idle Fellow</i> before I met him, and was consequently
in enjoyment of world-wide fame. He had established
in the <i>Idler</i> a monthly which had no equal then as
a magazine of fiction, and had a sale of a hundred thousand
copies a month, when he started <i>To-day</i>. He started it not
only to amuse, but to educate Public Opinion, when it had
secured attention by its brightness, for he had very strong
views which he was eager to preach.</p>

<p class='c016'>He was more of a Conservative than a Radical in those
days; he had not despaired of the Conservatives, then,
though he was baggy about beastly little nationalities.
Suffragism had not then begun its March of Unreason, and
we were all in favour of giving woman a vote. But I am
bound to register the conviction that, if Suffragism had been
a burning question then, the paper would have been full of
it, and enjoying a circulation of a million, or whatever
number the adult women suffragists run to. I can picture
Jerome, a man famous for his hospitalities, being reduced to
a hunger-strike by the ardour with which he would have
espoused the idea. He was always tilting against some
abuse, always asking for litigation. And he got it—or
I suppose he would be editing a newspaper now, instead of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>delighting both hemispheres with his plays. I say advisedly
“both hemispheres,” because he has a considerable public
as a dramatist in America.</p>

<p class='c016'>One of the first books on which I let myself go, and wrote
an absolute appreciation, was that magnificent historical
novel of Stanley Weyman’s, <i>A Gentleman of France</i>. Jerome
was delighted with the way I handled it.</p>

<p class='c016'>Seeing Jerome so much in the office led to our being a
good deal at each other’s houses. He was living at that time
in one of the nice old villas in St. John’s Wood. The chief
thing I remember about it was its cattiness and its scrupulous
tidiness. When you stay with him in the country, you
cannot leave your stick and hat in the hall, handy for running
out, as you might at Sandringham or Chatsworth. They are
at once arrested, and are very lucky if they get off with a
warning from the magistrate.</p>

<p class='c016'>One of my diametrical divergencies from Jerome is in the
love of cats. I cannot respect a cat. To me it is a beast of
prey, a sort of middle-class tiger, operating in a small way,
but at heart a murderer of the Asiatic jungle. Jerome loves
them, and makes dogs of them: he used to fill the <i>Idler</i>
with Louis Wain’s human deductions from cats. He has
a telephone to their brains. I agree with Lord Roberts,
who knows by instinct when there is a cat in the room,
though it may be wholly concealed, and cannot enjoy himself
until it is removed.</p>

<p class='c016'>Like most real humorists whom I have known, and I have
known many from Mark Twain and Bill Nye downwards,
Jerome is not a “funny man” in ordinary life. He is, on
the contrary, except when he is on his legs, before an audience,
or taking his pen in his hand, apt to be a very serious man,
though his conversation is always illuminated by flashes of
wit. He is much more apt to air strong opinions about
serious questions. The Jerome you see in <i>Paul Kelvin</i> and
<i>The Third Floor Back</i> is the real Jerome. He is the loyalest
friend and most tender-hearted man imaginable. His kindness
and hospitality are unbounded. You cannot stay with
Jerome in his own house without being inspired by the deepest
respect and affection for him. He is an ideal husband and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>father, a friend of the struggling, a just and generous master.
Like Conan Doyle, though he has never shone in first-class
cricket or golf, Jerome is very athletic in his tastes. In spite
of his glasses, he is a fine tennis-player and croquet-player;
he is a fine skater also, and devoted to the river and horses.
It was partly a horse accident in which he and Norma
Lorimer were involved, and both showed extraordinary
courage, which made me feel for him as I do.</p>

<p class='c016'>He is essentially an open-air man, whose thoughts are all
outside directly he has got through his statutory amount of
work with his secretary.</p>

<p class='c016'>But though the serious man weighs down the humorist
in Jerome, you would not guess it from his personal appearance.
When he rises to speak, his bright eye, the smile
playing round his mouth, his cool confident bearing, the
very way in which he arranges his hair, which has not yet
a particle of grey about it, is more suggestive of the humorist,
the man who is accustomed to making hundreds roar with
laughter at his speeches, and scores of thousands with the
flashes of his pen.</p>

<p class='c016'>Jerome has no love for London, though he has a town
residence and enjoys Bohemian society, and is very popular
in it. For many years he has lived on the Upper Thames,
and he is in the habit of going to Switzerland for the skating.</p>

<p class='c016'>I asked Carl Hentschel, who was one of the three who went
on the trip immortalised in <i>Three Men in a Boat</i>, to tell me
about it. He said—</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is rather interesting to look back to the days of <i>Three
Men in a Boat.</i> Jerome at that time was in a solicitor’s
office in Cecil Street, where the Hotel Cecil now stands,
George Wingrave was a junior clerk in a bank in the City,
and I was working in a top studio in Windmill Street, close
to where the Lyric Theatre now stands, having to look after
a lot of Communists, who had had to leave Paris. Our one
recreation was week-ending on the river. It was roughing
it in a manner which would hardly appeal to us now. Jerome
and Wingrave used to live in Tavistock Place, now pulled
down, and that was our starting-point to Waterloo and thence
to the river. It says much for our general harmony that,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>during the years we spent together in such cramped confinement,
we never fell out, metaphorically or literally. It
was Jerome’s unique style which enabled him to bring out
the many and various points in our trip. It was a spell of
bad weather that broke up our parties. A steady downpour
for three days would dampen even the hardiest river-enthusiast.
One incident, which, I believe, was never recorded,
but would have made invaluable copy in Jerome’s hands,
happened on one of our last trips. We were on our way up
the river, and late in the afternoon, as the sky looked threatening,
we agreed to pull up and have our frugal meal, which
generally consisted of a leg of Welsh mutton, bought at the
famous house in the Strand, now pulled down, with salad.
We started preparing our meal on the bank, when the threatened
storm burst. We hastily put up our canvas over the
boat, and bundled all the food into it anyhow. It got pitch
dark, and we were compelled to find the lamp and tried to
light it. After a while we found the lamp, but it would
not light; luckily we found two candle ends, and by their
feeble light began our meal. We had hardly begun our meal
when I said after the first mouthful of salad, ‘What’s wrong
with the salad?’ George also thought it was queer, but
Jerome thought there was nothing wrong. Jerome always
did have a peculiar taste. Anyhow, he was the only one who
continued. It was not till the next day that we discovered
that owing to our carelessness of using two medicine bottles
of similar shape, one containing vinegar and the other Colza
oil, the lamp and the salad were both a bit off.”</p>

<p class='c016'>When I asked Jerome what first gave him the idea of
writing he said—</p>

<p class='c016'>“I always wanted to be a writer. It seemed to me an
easy and dignified way of earning a living. I found it
difficult; I found it exposes you to a vast amount of abuse.
Sometimes, after writing a book or play which seemed to me
quite harmless, I have been staggered at the fury of indignation
it seems to have excited among my critics. If I had
been Galileo, attacking the solar science of the sixteenth
century, I could not have been assaulted by the high priests
of journalism with more anger and contempt. But the work
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>itself has always remained delightful to me. I think it was
Zangwill who said to me once, ‘A writer, to succeed, has to be
not only an artist, but a shopkeeper’—and of the two, the
shopkeeper is the more necessary. I am not sure who said
that last sentence; it may have been myself.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You write your book or play while talking to the morning
stars. It seems to you beautiful—wonderful. You thank
whatever gods there be for having made you a writer. The
book or the play finished, the artist takes his departure, to
dream of fresh triumphs. The shopkeeper—possibly a
married shopkeeper with a family—comes into the study,
finds the manuscript upon the desk. Then follows the selling,
bargaining, advertising. It is a pretty hateful business,
even with the help of agents. The book or the play you
thought so fine, you thought that every one was bound to
like it. Your publisher, your manager, is doubtful. You
have a feeling that they are accepting it out of sheer charity—possibly
they knew your father, or have heard of your early
struggles—and yield to an unbusinesslike sentiment of
generosity. It appears, and anything from a hundred to
two hundred and fifty experienced and capable journalists
rush at it to tear it to pieces. It is marvellous—their unerring
instinct. There was one sentence where the grammar
was doubtful—you meant to reconsider it, but overlooked
it; it appears quoted in every notice; nothing else in the
book appears to have attracted the least attention. At
nine-tenths of your play the audience may have laughed;
there was one scene which did not go well; it is the only
scene the critic has any use for. Their real feeling seems
to be that the writer is the enemy of the public; the duty of
all concerned is to kill him. If he escapes alive, that counts to
him.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I remember the first night of a play by my friend, Henry
Arthur Jones. There had been some opposition; it was
quite evident that the gallery were only waiting for him to
appear to ‘boo’ him, as if he had been a criminal on the way
to the scaffold. I was standing by the gallery exit, and the
people were coming out. Said one earnest student to
another, as they passed me, ‘Why didn’t the little——come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>out and take his punishment like a man?’ ‘Cowardly, I
call it,’ answered the other. They knew what was in store
for him in the next morning’s papers; they knew that a
year’s work, perhaps two, had been wasted. I suppose that
it would be asking too much to suggest that they might also
have imagined the heartache and the disappointment. The
playwright who does not succeed in keeping every one
of a thousand individuals, of different tastes and views and
temperaments, interested and amused for every single
minute of two hours, must not be allowed any mercy.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yet for a settled income of ten thousand a year, and no
worry, no abuse, and no insults, I do not think any of us
would exchange our job. I suppose we are all born gamblers—it
is worth risking the half-dozen failures for the one
success.</p>

<p class='c016'>“And the work itself, as I said—one only wishes one’s
readers enjoyed it half as much; circulations would be
fabulous. <i>Three Men in a Boat</i> I started as a guide to the
Thames. It occurred to us—George, Charles and myself—when
we were pulling up and down, how interesting and
improving it would be to know something about the history
of the famous places through which we passed; a little
botany might also be thrown in. I thought that other men
in boats might also like information on this subject, and
would willingly pay for it. So I read up Dugdale, and a
vast number of local guides, together with a little poetry and
some memoirs. I really knew quite a lot about the Thames
by the time I had done, and with a pile of notes in front of
me, I started. I think I had a vague idea of making it
a modern ‘Sandford and Merton.’ I thought George would
ask questions, and Harry intersperse philosophical remarks.
But George and Harry would not; I could not see them sitting
there and doing it. So gradually they came to have their
own way, and the book as a guide to the Thames is, I suppose,
the least satisfactory work on the market.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I suppose, like Mrs. Gummidge, I felt it more. It must
have been about five years before I succeeded in getting
anything of mine accepted. The regularity with which the
complimenting editor returned my manuscripts grew monotonous,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>grew heart-breaking. But, after all, it was <i>The
Times</i> newspaper which accepted my first contribution.
Some correspondence on the subject of the nude in Art made
me angry, and I wrote a letter intended to be ironic. It
attracted quite a lot of comment, and, fired by this success,
I wrote to <i>The Times</i> on other topics. The <i>Saturday Review</i>
praised their irony and humour, and Frank Harris invited
me a little later to contribute. But we differed, I think,
upon the subject of women.</p>

<p class='c016'>“<i>The Passing of the Third Floor Back</i> I wrote for David
Warfield, the American actor, and discussed the matter with
David Belasco in the train, when I was on a lecturing tour
in America. I read him and Warfield the play at the Belasco
Theatre in New York. It was after the performance was
over, and we three had the great empty theatre to ourselves.
Then we went to Lamb’s Club, and Warfield, I think, had
macaroni, and Belasco and I had kidneys and lager beer,
and discussed arrangements. Firstly Anderson was to
draw sketches of the characters, and it was while he was
doing this in his studio at Folkestone that Forbes-Robertson
dropped in for a chat. Percy Anderson talked to him about
the play, and Forbes-Robertson took up the manuscript
and read it. Belasco was a little nervous about the play.
I did not like the idea of forcing it upon him, and other
small difficulties had arisen, so, having heard from Percy
Anderson that he had talked to Forbes-Robertson about the
play, I thought I would go and see him. He, too, was nervous
about it, but said that he felt that he must risk it. We
produced it at Harrogate, for quite a nice, respectable
audience, and they took it throughout as a farce. One or
two critics came down from London, and commiserated with
Forbes-Robertson on his luck.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It was the miners of Blackpool who put heart into us;
they understood the thing, and were enthusiastic. Then we
produced it at St. James’, and, with one or two exceptions,
it was besieged with a chorus of condemnation—deplorable,
contemptible, absurd, were a few of the adjectives employed,
and Forbes-Robertson hastened on the rehearsals for another
play. A few days later, King Edward VII, passing through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>London on his way to Scotland, devoted his one night in
London to seeing the piece. He said it was not the sort of
thing he expected from Jerome, but he liked it. And about
the same time strange people began to come, who did not
know what the St. James’ Theatre was, and did not quite
know what to do when they got there, and they liked it,
too.”</p>

<p class='c016'>I first met Zangwill—Israel Zangwill—at one of the old
pothouse dinners of the Vagabond Club. He had not long
given up editing <i>Ariel</i>, and was already known for his biting
wit as a speaker. When the lean, arrestive figure of the
Jewish ex-schoolmaster craned over an assemblage, there
was always an attentive silence. He had not yet immortalised
himself by those inimitable etchings of Jewish life,
in which the graver and the acid were employed so ruthlessly—the
Tragedies and Comedies of the Ghetto. But he was
in sympathies already a novelist, for on that particular
occasion he was upbraiding Robert Buchanan for forsaking
literature for the drama. His own eyes have wandered to
the stage since then. The curly black hair—an orator’s
hair—the sallow complexion of the South, the pallor of the
student, the eagle nose, the assertive smile, the confident
paradox—how well I can recall them! He was a young
man in those days.</p>

<p class='c016'>Jerome was always a thorough believer in Zangwill. And
he showed his judgment by making him his first serialist
in <i>To-day</i>. He paid him five hundred pounds for the serial
rights of the first of those remarkable novels of Jewish life,
as much, I believe, as he paid for the serial rights of <i>Ebb-Tide</i>,
the book R. L. Stevenson wrote in collaboration with
his step-son, Lloyd Osbourne.</p>

<p class='c016'>Zangwill was a very constant and much-appreciated
visitor at our at-homes, as was that encyclopædia of knowledge,
his brother Louis. And their sisters sometimes came
with them. They all lived together in those days at Kilburn.
I remember going to a party at their house to meet Sir
Frederick Cowen, the musician, which had a most comical
finish. There were six of us left, and only one hansom
between us. Three got inside, two sat on the splash-board,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>and Heinemann spread himself on the roof in front of the man,
and kept filling the skylight with his face, like a Japanese
Oni. Phil May sat in the middle inside. He was very
excited, and we were trying to keep him quiet, so as not to
draw the attention of the police to the fact that the hansom
was carrying more than it was licensed for. When we got
to the Edgware Road, he began to yell for the police, and
a stalwart constable signalled to the cabby to heave to. He
advanced to the side of the cab. “What is the trouble,
sir?” he asked, preparing to rescue the artist from the literary
men among whom he had fallen.</p>

<p class='c016'>Phil gave one of his knowing smiles, and said, “I want to go
to Piccadilly Circus, and they are trying to take me home.”</p>

<p class='c016'>But to return to our Zangwills. Louis Zangwill had not
yet shown his strength as a writer, but any one who had
tested it, marvelled at the width of his knowledge. In
those days Israel Zangwill favoured Slapton Sands for his
summer holidays. We met him there. He used to wander
about in a black coat and white duck trousers, gathering
inspiration. The sunshine and scenery inspired him to be
a perfectly delightful companion. We once met him yet
further afield—at Venice. Norma Lorimer and I came
upon him and Bernard Sickert, the artist, in the Casa Remer,
an adorable old palace, with an open courtyard and a processional
stair, on the Grand Canal. It was quite unspoiled
by repairs in those days. It contained a curio-dealer by the
water’s edge, and at the head of the staircase was a large
room in which a very beautiful young Jewish girl sat sewing
for some sweating tailor. We had landed and made an
archæological excursion up the staircase, when we discovered
her. She arose, and with proper presence of mind, and with
a total absence of <i>mauvaise haute</i>, conducted us to the curio
shop kept by papa. There we met Zangwill and Sickert.
We were all of us tempted by some very beautiful mediæval
iron gates, which would have been a glory in any nobleman’s
park, but as we none of us had a park, and even the six
hundred francs he wanted for them, added to the cost of
transport to England, would have been a considerable sum
for any of us, we denied ourselves, and Zangwill gave a dinner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>in honour of the event, at a tiny restaurant on a screwy little
canal behind the Piazza of San Marco. The food and the
wine were excellent, and we sat on till the moon was high,
and Venice, on those small old canals, looked like a theatrical
representation of itself for <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>. Then
we wandered back to the Piazza to Florian’s, the café whose
proud boast it is that it has never closed its doors day or
night for four hundred years. If you are sleeping in Venice
on a summer night—and, in spite of its noise and its mosquitoes,
is there anything more adorable than Venice on
a summer night?—you will find that the habit is not confined
to Florian’s.</p>

<p class='c016'>At Florian’s we sat down to coffee. We could not get
a seat outside; the band was playing “La Bohême,” and the
municipality was throwing red and green limelight on San
Marco in honour of a royal birthday. There was no waiter
either, inside, and Sickert amused himself with drawing
an almost life-sized head of Zangwill with a piece of charcoal
which he had in his pocket, on the marble table. It was a
bit of a caricature, but far the best likeness I ever saw of the
great Jewish novelist. When the waiter did come, without
waiting to take our orders, he went to fetch a damp cloth to
clean the table. <i>Ars longa, vita brevis</i>—I would not let
him touch it, and told the proprietor what a prize he had
as I went out. I have often wondered what the fate of that
table was. Zangwill, the apostle of Zionism, has always
been intensely proud of his nationality, so he has never
minded cutting jokes about it. He brought the house down
at a Vagabond Christmas dinner, where he was taking the
chair, by remarking in his opening sentence, “It’s a funny
thing to ask a Jew to do.” This was the dinner at which he
introduced to English audiences the story which had lately
appeared in a German comic paper. A carpenter was in
a crowd waiting to see the Emperor pass. He had an excellent
position, but he was very uneasy because he had promised to
meet a conceited young brother-in-law, and the brother-in-law
had not turned up.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Will the Jackanapes never come!” cried the carpenter.
A policeman promptly arrested him.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>“I was speaking of my brother-in-law,” gasped the poor
carpenter.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You said ‘Jackanapes’; you must have meant the
Emperor,” said the policeman.</p>

<p class='c016'>When I asked Zangwill what made him turn to book-writing,
he said—</p>

<p class='c016'>“I never ‘turned’ to book-writing, because I never
thought of doing anything else, and I have said all I have
to say on that subject in the chapter of <i>My First Book</i>,
published by Chatto &amp; Windus, a book which should be a
sufficient mine to you for all your friends. I was told at the
Grosvenor Library that the middle-class Jews boycotted all
my books—in revenge for the Jewish ones—but the Jewish
‘intellectuals’ have always rallied round me, for I remember
that the Maccabeans gave me a dinner to celebrate the birth
of <i>Children of the Ghetto</i>—a dinner, by the way, at which
Tree announced, amid cheers, that he had commissioned
me to adapt <i>Uriel Acosta</i>. I never took the commission
seriously, but I gave him a one-act play, <i>Six Persons</i>, which
had a long run at the Haymarket (giving Irene Vanbrugh
her first good part), and still survives, twenty years after,
having been played quite recently at the Coliseum and the
Palladium by Margaret Halstan as well as by Miss Helen
Mar somewhere else.</p>

<p class='c016'>“An anecdote I remember telling at this dinner was:
A man said to me, ‘My son has had typhoid, but he enjoyed
himself reading your book.’</p>

<p class='c016'>“‘Where did he get it from?’ I asked, because it was
the old three-volume days, and I knew he could not have
bought it.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Thinking of the typhoid, he replied, ‘From the drains.’</p>

<p class='c016'>“This theory of the origin of my book is, I believe, favoured
in high ecclesiastical quarters.”</p>

<p class='c016'>I knew Mark Twain very well. He and Bret Harte were,
I suppose, the two most famous American authors who ever
came to our at-homes at No. 32. Bret Harte, though he
was such a typically American writer, spent all the latter
part of his life in England. I first met him at Rudolph
Lehmann’s hospitable dinner-table. No one could fail to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>struck with Bret Harte. He was so alert, so handsome, and
though his plumes—his hair was thick and sleek to the day he
died—were of an exquisite snow-white, he had a healthy,
fresh-coloured face, and a slender, youthful figure, always
dressed like a well-off young man. He used to come to our
house with the Vaudeveldes. Madame Vaudevelde, herself
an authoress, and the daughter of a famous ambassador, kept
a suite of rooms in her great house in Lancaster Gate for
his use, whenever he was in London.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Don’t you ever go back to California nowadays?” I
asked him once.</p>

<p class='c016'>“No. I dare say that if I saw the new California, with
all its go-aheadness and modernness, I should lose the old
California that I knew, whereas now it has never changed for
me. I can picture everything just as it was when I left it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>He retained his vogue to the end. Any magazine would
pay him at the rate of a couple of pounds for every hundred
words. They used to say that the Bank of England would
accept his manuscripts as banknotes. He never failed to
charm, whether he was telling some story at a dinner-party, or
talking to some undistinguished woman, young and beautiful
or old and plain, who had asked to be introduced to him as
a celebrity—and a celebrity Francis Bret Harte certainly
was, for he founded a whole school in English literature.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mark Twain was also very kind, but when I was in New
York he was living at Hartford, the capital of the adjoining
State of Connecticut. He described himself to me as a
“wooden nutmeg,” in allusion to a former thriving industry
of the State. I met him when he was engaged to entertain
a ladies’ school at New York. That did not cost nothing.
The idea seemed to me very American, that an author at the
height of his fame, as Mark Twain then was—for he was
fifty-five years old, and it was twenty-one years since he
leapt into fame with <i>The Jumping Frog</i>, should accept an
engagement to “give a talk” in a private house. The
school received good value for its fee. He not only gave them
an hour’s entrancing address, but he stayed on till quite a
late train, having anybody and everybody introduced to
him, and being cordial to them all. Nor was his cordiality
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>short-lived. I had done nothing then, except publish a few
books of verse. Yet we became and remained till the day of
his death, twenty years later, familiar friends. This was
before I received that memorable invitation from Oliver
Wendell Holmes to be his guest at the monthly meeting of
the Saturday Club at Boston, where Mark Twain proved
that the English were mentioned in the Bible.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c011'><sup>[2]</sup></a> He told
story after story in that address, but I don’t remember any
of them. They were all good in tendency, that was one
thing; there was no making fun of anything that was good
or noble or sincere with him. He was, like our own humorist,
Jerome, intensely serious in his soul, and he was projecting
a big book about the Bible—as a publisher, for he was
already in the publishing firm of Charles L. Webster &amp; Co.,
who were producing the huge <i>Library of American Literature</i>,
of which E. C. Stedman was joint editor.</p>

<div class='footnote c023' id='f2'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When challenged to prove it, he read out the text,
“For the meek shall inherit the earth.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c016'>In order to make all great men authors, it had the idea to
give the most famous sayings of historical Americans, where
they had not written anything. In this way Abraham
Lincoln became an author. I expect that it was that
encyclopædia which years afterwards brought the house of
Charles L. Webster &amp; Co. down, though it was sold “on
subscription,” with thousands of copies ordered before the
book was begun. Mark Twain found himself responsible
for debts of fifty thousand pounds. I met him soon afterwards,
and began condoling with him on his losses as a
publisher. He replied, “I am no publisher, nor ever was.
I only put the money up for them to play with.”</p>

<p class='c016'>To make up his losses to him, a leading American firm—I
seem to recollect that it was the Harpers, but I may be
wrong—made him a gigantic “syndicate” proposal for all
rights, which brought in large sums of money.</p>

<p class='c016'>When I met him then, he had just come off ship-board.
I asked him how he was.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Better’n I ever was in my life. I’ve gotten a new lease.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, it’s a long story. You must know that when I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>staying in a hotel, or on board ship, I can’t go to bed while
there is one person left to talk to in the bar. This habit,
I don’t know what ways exactly, gave me a cough that I
couldn’t get rid of, till an old Auntie from Georgia told me
to try drops of rum on sugar. It took away my cough, and
I liked it fine. I went on taking it after my cough had gone;
it grew to be a habit, and before I knew where I was my
digestion had gone. I tried all the doctors I could hear of,
at home, and in England, and in Germany, including Austria,
to cure that. But it was not possible; all they could do
for me was to find out what I liked best to eat or drink, and
tell me to do without it. I was wasting to a shadow, so
I sent for my own doctor, and said to him, ‘Doctor, I can’t
stand this any longer; life isn’t worth living, what there is
going to be of it, and that doesn’t seem to be much. I am
going to commit suicide.’ ‘Maybe it is the best thing to do,’
he said. ‘Do you know what is the most painless form of
death?’ ‘Yes,’ said I, ‘I am going to eat and drink everything
I like best for a week, and according to all of you, it
ought to take much less time than that.’</p>

<p class='c016'>“So I did, and I assure you, Mr. Sladen, before the week
was up, I was as well as ever I had been in my life.”</p>

<p class='c016'>He could reel off this sort of story by the hour, with that
slow drawl of his, which was so mightily effective.</p>

<p class='c016'>Frank Stockton, the kindliest and most delicate humorist
of America, I knew very well, and any one who knew him
intimately could not help regarding him with affection.
He was a little man with a club foot, and rather a timid
expression, which he made use of when telling his immortal
after-dinner stories; he emphasised the timidity until the
point came, and his face was wreathed with smiles. Stockton
was a great gardener. His garden out at the Holt near the
Convent station in New Jersey was large and beautiful, and
the product of his own imagination. It seemed incredible
that a garden like that should have no kind of a hedge or
fence, but he explained that in America to put a fence round
your garden is considered an insult to the democracy, who
by no means always deserve to be trusted in this matter.</p>

<p class='c016'>Stockton was so good-natured that his wife used to say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>he would never have done any work at all if he had not had
a dragon at his side to guard him. She was not much like
a dragon. But on one point she was inexorable; when the
time had really come for him to set about fulfilling a contract,
she insisted on his going into New York to a hotel with as
blank an outlook as possible, so that he should not waste
time over gardening; he could not trust himself within sight
of a green leaf.</p>

<p class='c016'>Stockton was a wood-engraver to start with, and was
thirty-eight years old before he abandoned it to do editorial
work. A year later he became assistant-editor of <i>St. Nicholas</i>,
the American children’s magazine. It was not until 1880
that he gave it up to devote himself entirely to book-writing.
Up till 1879, the year in which he published <i>Rudder Grange</i>,
he only wrote children’s books, and he did not publish his
next book for grown-ups, <i>The Lady or the Tiger</i>, for another
five years.</p>

<p class='c016'>Another old member of the Vagabond Club, always a
very intimate friend of Jerome’s, who was often at our
at-homes was Pett Ridge, the humorist whose knowledge
of the East End of London is sometimes compared to
Dickens’s; indeed, many consider him unequalled as a writer
of Cockney humour and an interpreter of Cockney humanity.
Unlike Jerome, Pett Ridge, who also has very earnest convictions
and has done a world of good, has the humorist
in him always near the surface. He used to be a constant
speaker at literary clubs, and most popular for his never-failing
fund of humour, which was heightened by his demure
delivery.</p>

<div id='i098f'  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>JEROME K. JEROME<br /><i>Drawn by Yoshio Markino</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c016'>With Pett Ridge, it is natural to mention W. W. Jacobs,
our best sea humorist. People used to be surprised that
the small, slight, youthful-looking man, who was known
to them as a clerk in the General Post Office, should be the
delineator of those inimitable captains and bo’suns and hands
before the mast of little sailing-craft which ply round our
coasts. He was one of the men to whom the members of
the general public, who strayed to literary dinners, were most
anxious to be introduced. Their admiration made him shy,
and it was a long time before he grew accustomed to do himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>justice in his public speeches, for he is one of our most
genuine humorists. He owed his unique knowledge of
coasting-craft and their navigators to the fact that his
father owned a wharf on the Thames, and that it was one
of his chief pleasures as a boy to go down to the wharf and
make friends with the sea-dogs. After his marriage he went
to live in Essex, but, as a bachelor living in London, he
was a very familiar figure at our at-homes. To those who
frequented literary gatherings in the days of which I am
speaking, it is natural to think of H. G. Wells with Pett
Ridge and Jacobs, but Wells was much less seen at these
gatherings, because he lived out of town at Worcester Park.
He was already married when I made his acquaintance, and
had got through the first marvellous part of his career, on
which he draws for so many of his books.</p>

<p class='c016'>He and his wife found a great difficulty in coming to our
at-homes, because they were such very late-at-night affairs.
Once they stayed with us, sleeping at the Temperance Hotel
round the corner, called rather inappropriately the “London
and Scottish,” because all our bedrooms were turned into
sitting-rooms for the night. The pair of them looked ridiculously
young. Wells was very boyish in those days; he
was slight in figure and youthful in face, with thick, rebellious,
fairish hair, and a charmingly impulsive manner. It seems
odd to think now that then he suffered from such very bad
health that he was not expected to live long. Those were
the days in which he used to write about flying men and
scientific millennia, most brilliant books which told the
British public that a genius had dropped from heaven,
whose crumbs were picked up by Mr. John Lane. Wells
became a Vagabond at a very early date, but he disliked
making speeches, and, in point of fact, hardly ever did make
one in his early days, so his wonderful literary gift was not
recognised so quickly as it would have been if he had been
constantly making speeches before literary clubs and other
large audiences.</p>

<p class='c016'>A feature of Wells’ writing is his marvellous versatility.
He will make a hit on entirely fresh lines, indulge the public
with a few other books on these lines, and then, before they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>have time to tire of them, break out in another fresh vein.
It is hard to believe that the same man wrote <i>Select Conversations
with an Uncle</i> and <i>Marriage</i>, though it is true that
seventeen years elapsed between their publication, and there
were many changes of style between the two. In those
days he was only a brilliant novelist; now we recognise in
him a profound thinker, a solver of social problems, even if
we ourselves are Conservatives.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the <i>New Machiavelli</i> and <i>Marriage</i> there is intuition
in every page and almost every line. You can read them
with sheer delight for the writing alone; they do not depend
on the story, however excellent.</p>

<p class='c016'>Another humorist who was a constant visitor was Max
O’Rell—the genial and irascible Frenchman who, as Paul
Blouet, the name to which he was born, was principal French
master at St. Paul’s School. Max O’Rell lived in a house
with a garden at St. John’s Wood. We were very fond of
him and his pretty wife, and much shocked when the two
blows fell so quickly upon one another. Max O’Rell fought
for France against the Germans, and he always looked a
fighting man, with his strong figure and belligerent moustache.
He was a fine fencer, and had, I am sure, fought duels in his
time; with his temperament he could not have kept out
of them; he was up in arms in a moment. I remember
how fiercely he turned upon Norma Lorimer for using the
expression, “The British Channel.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why British?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c016'>But he was quite floored by the repartee, “Because of
the weather.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Max O’Rell was always quick at repartee himself—except
in America. Of America and Americans he always spoke in
public with his tongue in his cheek, but in private he was
“screamingly funny” about them. He should certainly
have left a posthumous volume of unpalatable truths about
America. It would not have hurt him in the Great Beyond,
and it would have convulsed the English-speaking world.
He must often have felt in America as he felt at Napier, New
Zealand, where the audience at the Mechanics’ Institute, or
some such place, would have none of him.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>“I am good enough for London and Paris,” he said,
speaking to me about it afterwards; “I am good enough for
New York, Boston and Chicago; I am good enough for
Melbourne and Sydney. But I am not good enough for
Napier, New Zealand—Napier, with its five thousand
inhabitants, etc., etc.”</p>

<p class='c016'>He had the same staccato style in his lectures and after-dinner
speeches as he had in his <i>John Bull and His Island</i>
and his other famous books, and he easily drifted into it in
his conversations.</p>

<p class='c016'>Other humorists of the little circle—it is to be noted
how many there were—were Robert Barr, Barry Pain and
W. L. Alden. Barr, as co-editor of the <i>Idler</i>, was a pivot
of literary society like Jerome. But his home for a considerable
portion of the period was a long way down in
Surrey, too far for his friends to pursue him to it. This was
not without design, for he was a man so fitted to shine in
literary society, that his one chance of writing his delicate
and delightful novels was to bury himself in the country.</p>

<p class='c016'>He made his reputation as “Luke Sharp,” the most
brilliant humorist of the <i>Detroit Free Press</i>, at that time the
most-quoted paper in America, and he was very American
both in appearance and speech. His brusqueness and
pugnacity were at times terrifying, but underneath them lay
a gentle nature and a most affectionate heart. He was a
man who inspired and returned the warmest affection. His
grim humour was famous: it suited the handsome features,
marred with smallpox, the close-trimmed naval officer’s
beard, the sturdy frame, the strong American accent, much
better than his dainty love-stories did. There was no more
popular speaker; his influence among his fellow-journalists
was unbounded. He and his pretty and charming wife, an
excellent foil for his pugnacious exterior, were frequent hosts
at the Idler teas, and frequent guests at our flat. Barr was
very biting about England’s national foibles, but they
never moved him to such outbursts of righteous indignation
as the intermittent immoralities of the United States
Government.</p>

<p class='c016'>He remained faithful to his birthplace till his premature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>death, for he called two successive homes of his in the South,
Hillhead, after the district of Glasgow in which he was born.
In his later days he was so much the editor, so much the
novelist, that one forgot the humorist, except when he was
convulsing a knot of friends, to whom he was talking at a
reception, or the audience he was addressing across a dinner-table.</p>

<p class='c016'>Barry Pain and W. L. Alden, on the other hand, were
always humorists. Alden, who had a most whimsical mind,
had been the American Consul-General at Rome, and had,
in consequence, been made a Cavaliere by the Italian Government.
His title was part of his humorous equipment. It
seemed so droll that a typical, middle-class American like
Alden, should be a cavalier. Both he and his wife were
kindly and agreeable people, but most of his personality
went into his writing.</p>

<p class='c016'>Barry Pain, on the other hand, had a forceful personality.
Whenever you meet this cheery cynic, with his bright dark
eyes, you know that you are in the presence of a man who
was born to be editor of <i>Punch</i>. He was a constant speaker
at literary clubs, though I don’t think that he liked speaking
at first. His speeches were full of the same brilliant paradoxes
as his books. His cynicism was tempered by overflowing
good-nature. He was always such a hearty man. He was
another of the people who soon flew into the country to get
away from parties, and have time for his numerous contributions
to weekly journals. But while he lived in London
he was very often at our house. I made his acquaintance
at the Lehmanns’—he married Stella Lehmann—soon after
he had come down from Cambridge. At Cambridge he had
been R. C. Lehmann’s bright particular star in Granta, and
Lehmann, who had wealth, good looks, and a brilliant
athletic record to back up his very great abilities as a writer,
had at once become influential in London journalistic circles.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER X<br /> <br /><span class='c022'>THE POETS AT OUR AT-HOMES</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>To</span> use the famous expression applied by Dr. Johnson to
his College at Oxford, we had quite a nest of singing-birds
at 32 Addison Mansions, for, to mention only three of them,
William Watson, John Davidson and Richard le Gallienne
were at the same time habitués of our at-homes, and Bliss
Carman, the Canadian, was constantly with us when he was
over here.</p>

<p class='c016'>Sir Lewis Morris, who was considered likely to succeed
Tennyson as laureate at a time when those young poets were
in the nursery, sometimes walked down from the Reform
Club to call on us, but he always came on odd afternoons, a
tall man, with a gaunt red face, who in those days was inclined
to put his poetical triumphs behind him, and be the Liberal
politician. Personally, I much preferred the poems of Lord
de Tabley, a delightfully dignified, gentle and affable personage.
His poems have never received full justice; for
Graeco-Roman atmosphere he must be classed with those
who come just below Shelley, Keats and Matthew Arnold—above
Horne’s “Orion,” I think.</p>

<p class='c016'>Edmund Gosse, who introduced me to Lord de Tabley,
introduced me also to the late H. O. Houghton, at that
time head of the eminent publishing firm of Houghton,
Mifflin &amp; Co., the John Murrays of America, and to the
late Richard Watson Gilder, editor of the <i>Century Magazine</i>,
two men at whose houses I met all the most famous authors
of Boston and New York respectively. Gosse, who had for
his brother-in-law the late Sir Alma Tadema, lived in those
days at Delamere Terrace, and at his house on Sunday
afternoons you always met authors of real distinction, men
like Lord de Tabley, Maarten Maartens, Austin Dobson, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Wolcott Balestier, Kipling’s brother-in-law, the type of
genius in a frail body. Edmund Gosse, besides being one
of those poets, rare nowadays, who preserve the traditional
grace of form, the distillation of thought which characterises
the poetical masters of the “Golden Treasury,” was instrumental
in giving England Ibsen and the other Scandinavian
giants of the generation.</p>

<p class='c016'>Austin Dobson, a man who has the mild and magnificent
eye of Browning’s <i>Lost Leader</i>, the Horace of lighter English
poetry, began life, like Gosse, as a Civil Servant, and, like
Gosse, is as felicitous in his essays and his criticisms as in
his poems. But, since he lived at Ealing and had five sons
and five daughters, he was very little to be seen at literary
gatherings in the days of which I speak.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is natural to mention Andrew Lang with them. They
were the three best lighter poets of their generation, but Lang
had the advantage over the others of being one of the most
brilliant scholars of his time—no man since the mighty
Conington displayed such a mass of classical erudition,
combined with a genius for popularising it, especially in the
direction of translation. Lang’s prose translations can be
compared with Conington’s rhymed versions of Virgil and
Horace. He had also a passion for the occult, and was one of
the best scholars in comparative occultology and mythology.</p>

<p class='c016'>His tall, lean figure, mop of grey hair, and screwed-up
scholar’s eyes, were as familiar among golfers and anglers
as at the Savile Club, and other literary coteries, which he
deigned to honour with his presence. He reduced rudeness
to a fine art, and never showed his heart to any one old enough
to understand it. But he was nearly a big man as well as a
big scholar.</p>

<p class='c016'>One cannot think of Lang without thinking also of
Frederic W. H. Myers, whom I met far earlier. As a child he
was remarkable; at thirteen, on entering Cheltenham College
(where I was educated long afterwards), so precocious was
his scholarship that he was placed with boys of seventeen
and eighteen. I doubt if there ever has lived another English
boy who learned the whole of Virgil by heart for his own
pure delight, before he passed the school age. He won the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>senior classical scholarship in his first year at thirteen;
besides gaining the first prize for Latin lyrics, he sent in two
English poems in different metres, and both were the best
and came out top!</p>

<p class='c016'>At the university few men have won more honours. Myers
was to Cambridge as Lang was to Oxford—and more also.
He was greater in pure scholarship, and far greater as a
poet, for he wrote “St. Paul,” almost the finest quatrain
poem in the English language. His later volume of poems,
entitled <i>The Renewal of Youth</i>, is perhaps less well known,
but this was the poem that he himself cared for most, and its
compressed force and intensity of feeling and wonderful beauty
of expression have gained it a steadily increasing public.</p>

<p class='c016'>In his later years he became more absorbed in psychical
research. The success of his famous work, <i>Human Personality,
and its Survival of Bodily Death</i>, is well known. The
epilogue, pp. 341-352, has become almost a classic, and
the book has now been translated into nearly all European
languages. This would have surprised Frederic Myers
enormously. He wrote to a friend in 1900, “I am occupied
in writing a big book which I don’t expect any one to read,
but I do it for the satisfaction of my own conscience.”
He laboured in this field up to his death, with the same ardour
and strenuousness that he threw into all his work.</p>

<p class='c016'>He was a wonderful personality—no one who ever saw
his unforgettable eyes, and beautiful majestic head, and heard
his marvellously eloquent voice, could ever forget him.
Myers is buried just where he should be buried—by the side
of Shelley and John Addington Symonds in the new Protestant
cemetery at Rome, under the ancient cypresses which top
the city wall. Close by, this wall of Aurelian is pierced by
the gate through which St. Paul was led to his martyrdom.
The people who stood on the wall where the author of “St.
Paul” lies buried, could have seen the Saint pass out.</p>

<p class='c016'>Myers and H. M. Stanley married two sisters. I always
though it so appropriate that Stanley’s brother-in-law, one
of the greatest scholars Cambridge ever nursed, should have
been so great an explorer in the Universe. A mutual friend
told me that when Myers was on his deathbed, Henry Sidgwick,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>the philosopher, quoted to Mrs. Myers some lines in “The
Renewal of Youth,” the poem which Myers himself, and many
of his Cambridge friends, thought the best of all his work—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ah, welcome then that hour which bids thee lie</div>
      <div class='line in1'>In anguish of thy last infirmity!</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Welcome the toss for ease, the gasp for air,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The visage drawn, and Hippocratic stare;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Welcome the darkening dream, the lost control,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The sleep, the swoon, the arousal of the soul!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c025'>Sidgwick thought these lines, and indeed, the whole poem,
wonderful, far finer than “St. Paul.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Of the younger generation of the poets, four of the most
noted, William Watson, W. B. Yeats, John Davidson and
le Gallienne, were at one time almost weekly at our flat.
Watson, whose powerful clean-shaven face always reminded
me of Charles James Fox, before that inventor of irresponsible
Liberalism lost his looks by dissipation, I see still sometimes.
It was only last year that he and his beautiful young wife
asked me to visit them at their house in the country.</p>

<p class='c016'>The sturdy Yorkshire stock of which he came is reflected
in his poems. He is accustomed to think and write upon
large national and international movements, and he has a
splendid gift of sonorous and epigrammatic diction. I did
not share the views he expressed, but that did not prevent
me from admiring the way in which he expressed them. In
my mind, there was no question but that the laureateship
lay between him and Kipling. But at Oxford Bridges already
had a reputation as a poet while I was an undergraduate.</p>

<p class='c016'>When Yeats first came to our house he was a shock-headed
Irish boy of twenty-six, without any regard for his personal
appearance. He did not care whether he had any studs in
his shirt or not, and once he came in evening dress without a
tie. But we knew then that he was a genius, and the world
knows it now. He has a fairy-like muse, whose quill is dipped
in pathos. He had then only just given up the idea of being
an artist, like his father. He was an art student for three
years. His poems and plays will live.</p>

<p class='c016'>Yeats was very naïve. I remember his complaining to me
in the early days of the Irish Literary Society that it suffered
under a grave disadvantage; its authors were unable to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>write as “nationalistically” as they would have desired,
because the Irish never bought books, and the brutal Saxon
would not buy them if they went too far in denouncing him.
Those were not his exact words, but they give the substance
of them. One might fancy that these young men and young
women, falling between the devil and the deep sea, took
refuge in playwriting, because the Englishman will go and
see a play which is sufficiently pathetic or sufficiently funny,
no matter how disloyal to himself its sentiments may be;
but his purse-strings are tighter with regard to displeasing
books. Yeats was always highly appreciated. When he
published <i>John Sherman</i> it was thought that he had a career
as a novelist before him, but he did not follow this up.</p>

<p class='c016'>Another Irishman whom I may mention here is Dr. Todhunter,
though he already had some silver in his beard twenty
years ago, and was the <i>doyen</i> of our poets, and at the beginning
the most considerable in his accomplishments. He had made
his name with “The Black Cat” and the “Sicilian Idyll,”
and belonged to an older generation.</p>

<p class='c016'>English literature is much the poorer by John Davidson
having taken his own life, in despair at the scantiness of the
rewards which his genius could earn. Davidson was a man
I liked very much. His robust personality was reflected in
his brilliant eyes and colouring. His heartiness and sincerity
were transparent and he was a very vital poet. He came
often. Davidson was inspired; there are lines of white
fire in “The Ballad of the Nun.” His cheery, courageous
face and blithe smile did not in the least suggest a man who
would commit suicide; they were much more suggestive of
the bloods who lived in the piping times of King George III.
He was another Lane discovery, I think, and I suspect that
Lane brought him to our house, as he brought Beardsley
and many another man destined to be celebrated, W. J.
Locke among them.</p>

<p class='c016'>Le Gallienne I knew better than any of them. He and his
brother-in-law, James Welch, were conspicuous features at
our parties, Welch because he was irresistibly funny, and in
the habit of exercising his wonderful gift of mimicry at odd
moments—we all believed in his future eminence.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Le Gallienne was even more conspicuous for his personal
appearance and frank posing. He had a face like Shelley,
and the true hyacinthine curls, if hyacinthine curls mean
the rich, waving black hair which one associates with the
Greeks of mythology. He was really a rather vigorous and
athletic man, and he used to say in the most captivating way,
“You mustn’t mind me letting my hair grow, and living up
to it—it is part of my stock-in-trade. People wouldn’t come
to hear me lecture without it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Undoubtedly his picturesque appearance made him one
of the most striking figures in any literary assemblage, but
he also had splendid gifts as a poet. I have always thought
that his version of Omar Khayyam is one of the most beautiful,
and has never received justice in comparison with other
versions. Like Fitzgerald, he was unable to translate from
the original, but that did not signify, because hardly any one
in England, in or out of the Omar Khayyam Club, can understand
the original, and the most popular version of the
Rubaiyat is valued, not for what Omar put into it, but for
what Fitzgerald put into it. Huntly McCarthy, who was
only in our house once or twice, did, of course, actually make
a translation of the Rubaiyat, but he is a literary marvel
who has not yet come into his own, author of exquisite poems,
and of some of the most brilliant and delightful historical
novels by any living writer. His father, the genial leader
of the Home Rule Party, who loved Ireland without hating
England, and wrote history blindfolded to prejudice, that
grand old man, Justin McCarthy, was a much more frequent
visitor. I can see him now, with his long beard, and eloquent
Irish eyes behind very conspicuous glasses, leaning on his
daughter Charlotte, and I can hear his rich brogue. It was a
great honour to be admitted to the intimate friendship of
Justin McCarthy, and when he grew more infirm, and went
to die at Westgate, where he lived on for a surprising
time, he never failed to remember me with a line at
Christmas.</p>

<p class='c016'>I ought to mention Oscar Wilde here, who had a wonderful
gift of poetical expression, and whom I met when we were
both undergraduates at Oxford, where he used to call himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>O. O’F. Wills Wilde—Oscar O’Flaherty Wills Wilde. He
was always known as Wills Wilde.</p>

<p class='c016'>But our parties were too crowded for him; he prefered to
come to see me on a chance afternoon, like Lewis Morris.
He hated having people introduced to him, until he had
expressed the desire that they should have the honour, and
in meetings so Bohemian he could not have escaped it. He
took a scholarship at Oxford, and won the University prize
for the English poem, and I rather think he got a First Class,
but one did not think of him <i>dans cette galère</i>. He had,
even in those days, a desire to be conspicuous, and in those
days æstheticism pranced through the land. Garments of
funny-coloured green baize, with a Greek absence of any
pretence at dressmaking, were the badge of the æsthetic
female, who to take first prize was required to have red hair
and green eyes, and a mouth like a magenta foxglove. And
the idea was that men should wear black velvet knickerbocker
suits, with silk stockings and black velvet caps like pancakes.
I never saw them doing it, except in an æsthetic pottery
shop in the Queen’s Road, Bayswater, where they sold
Aspinall’s enamels, and on the stage, where Gilbert and
Sullivan’s <i>Patience</i> took the place now occupied by works
of genius like Bernard Shaw’s <i>Chocolate Soldier</i>. Wilde never
wore the dress at Oxford, but he was quite courageous in
adjuncts. At one time he banished all the decorations from
his rooms, except a single blue vase of the true æsthetic type
which contained a “Patience” lily. He was discovered by
the other undergraduates of Magdalen prostrated with grief
before it because he never could live up to it. They did
what they could to revive him by putting him under the
college pump.</p>

<p class='c016'>But they applauded his wit, at the coining of a famous
example of which I was privileged to be present. We were
both in for a Divinity exam. at the same time. There was no
Honour school in Divinity; it was simply a qualifying exam.
to show that we had sufficient knowledge of the rudiments
of the religion of the Church of England to be graduates
of a religious university; we used to call the exam. “Rudiments”
for short.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>I went to the exam., like a good young man, at the advertised
hour, nine o’clock; Wilde did not arrive till half-an-hour
later, and when Spooner, the Head of New College, who was
one of our examiners, asked him what he meant by being
so late, he said, “You must excuse me; I have no experience
of these pass examinations.”</p>

<p class='c016'>It was the morning of the <i>viva voce</i> examinations, and his
being late did not really signify because W is one of the
last letters in the alphabet. But the examiners were so
annoyed at his impertinence that they gave him a Bible,
and told him to copy out the long twenty-seventh chapter
of the Acts. He copied it out so industriously in his exquisite
handwriting that their hearts relented, and they told him
that he need not write out any more. Half-an-hour afterwards
they noticed that he was copying it out as hard as ever, and
they called him up to say, “Didn’t you hear us tell you,
Mr. Wilde, that you needn’t copy out any more?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Oh yes,” he said, “I heard you, but I was so interested
in what I was copying, that I could not leave off. It was all
about a man named Paul, who went on a voyage, and was
caught in a terrible storm, and I was afraid that he would
be drowned, but, do you know, Mr. Spooner, he was saved,
and when I found that he was saved, I thought of coming to
tell you.”</p>

<p class='c016'>As Mr. Spooner was nephew of the Archbishop of Canterbury,
the insult was of a peculiarly aggravating nature, and
he ploughed him then and there. As my name also came
low down in the alphabet, I was a witness of the whole
performance.</p>

<p class='c016'>Herbert Trench, the poet, who, when he became a theatrical
manager, discovered the “Blue Bird,” often came, a very
handsome Irishman of the blue-eyed and black-haired type.
I met him when he and I were fellow members of the House
Committee which discussed the poorness of the dinners at
the old Authors’ Club.</p>

<p class='c016'>Frederick Langbridge, the charming poet, who was joint
author of Martin Harvey’s evergreen “Only Way,” only
came once or twice, because, like Dean Swift, he was exiled
by an Irish preferment. He is Rector of Limerick.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Wilde once brought a friend with him, whose name was
Barlass. He wrote poetry which Wilde admired, though it
had no market, and claimed to be a descendant of the
Katherine Douglas who barred the door with her arm when
the bolt had been stolen, to save King James III of Scotland
from his murderers, and was nicknamed Katherine Barlass.
I have a volume of his poems still, but the thing I remember
best about him was an episode which happened when we
were both at Wilde’s house in Tite Street one day. Upstairs
in the drawing-room he had asked Wilde, “What do you think
of George Meredith’s novels?”</p>

<p class='c016'>Wilde, having nothing effective to say at the moment,
appeared not to hear him. But as he was going out of the
front door, he said, “George Meredith is a sort of prose
Browning,” and when Barlass was halfway down Tite Street,
he called after him, “And Browning also is a sort of prose
Browning.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Bliss Carman wrote some of the most delightful poetry
of them all. Born in Canada, where they have eternal
sunshine in summer, and brought up in those parts of the
Maritime provinces where little mountains and little lakes
and little rivers and little forests combine with a bold coastline
to make Acadia an Arcady, it was only natural that he should
be able to transfigure in his poems the Old World Arcady,
with Pan, Faun, Syrinx and Adonis, and all the lovely rabble
of mountain, sea and woodland nymphs.</p>

<p class='c016'>Carman could write from a typical Canadian inspiration
also. He could make you see Grandpré, and the lives of
the men who won Canada from the wilds and maintained a
seignorial grace of life in the new France, which was born
in the days of the Roi Soleil, and lived under the white flag
till it went down in the glorious sunset on the heights of
Abraham. Carman’s poetry is rich in romance, and he was
a romantic figure, for with his great stature and fair hair,
and blue eyes, he looked as if he might have been one of the
Norsemen led to the far north of the continent by Leif, the
son of Erik, a thousand years ago, whose descendants were
discovered roaming in the Arctic only the other day. As a
matter of fact, he was descended from one of the most famous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>men among the United Empire loyalists, who left the
United States when they could no longer live there under the
British flag, and gave Canada her unconquerable backbone.</p>

<p class='c016'>I should have mentioned ere this two dear friends of ours
who are both dead—William Sharp and Gleeson White.
White was one of my oldest literary friends. We knew him
when we were living at Richmond before we went to America,
and saw a lot of him during the three years we were
there. We came home, I think, just before him. William
Sharp introduced him to us. Sharp, who was the friend of
nearly every well-known author of his time, began life as
poet and critic. As general editor of the “Canterbury Poets,”
his name is a household word. There was no wider-minded
critic, none who had a wider knowledge of the poetry and
other verses of his day. But his chief contribution to literature
consisted of the works of “Fiona Macleod,” which
were never acknowledged as his during his lifetime, though he
never denied their authorship to me. We saw him frequently,
not only at Addison Mansions, but abroad, for, like ourselves,
he was an insatiable wanderer over Italy and Sicily.</p>

<p class='c016'>Gleeson White did not write much verse himself, but he
edited a volume of society verses under the title of <i>Ballades
and Rondeaux</i>, in the “Canterbury Poets,” which had a
really public effect. It collected the best examples of the
ballades and rondeaux, and verse in other old French forms,
written by Gosse and Dobson, and Lang, and other well-known
writers, in such a convenient form, and gave the
rules for writing them so clearly, that everybody who had
any skill in versifying set to work to write ballades and rondeaux,
and bombard the magazines and newspapers with
them. There was a rage of ballade-writing which can only
be compared to the limerick competitions of <i>Pearson’s Weekly</i>.
Of Gleeson White’s accomplishments as an art critic I have
spoken elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c016'>Edgar Fawcett, the New Yorker who was so often at our
parties on both sides of the Atlantic, was one of the best
American writers of ballades, though thousands of American
writers, according to the sardonic Miss Gilder, turned them
out by machinery.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Sharp himself was more inclined to the sonnet, as was our
mutual friend, Theodore Watts (now Watts-Dunton), who
lived with Swinburne at the Pines, Putney, and will always
be remembered as Swinburne’s greatest friend. Watts’s
sonnets in the <i>Athenæum</i> became as well known to literary
people as Dr. Watts’s hymns. They were among the best
sonnets of the day. Watts was Swinburne’s companion
on his famous swimming excursions. Like the matchless
poet who refused the laureateship, he was a magnificent
swimmer.</p>

<p class='c016'>Hall Caine was at that time the chief authority upon the
sonnet, as he was one of the chief literary critics of the
<i>Athenæum</i> and the <i>Academy</i>. He gave me about that time
his <i>Sonnets of Three Centuries</i>, which I still keep.</p>

<p class='c016'>Two other followers of the Muse who came to our parties
were Mackenzie Bell and Norman Gale.</p>

<p class='c016'>Adrian Ross—Arthur Reed Ropes—who so long carried
on a dual literary life—a Fellow of King’s, an Examiner to
the University, and writer of text-books at Cambridge, while
he wrote the songs for George Edwardes’s musical comedies
in London, was a friend of ours before he came to live in
Addison Mansions, partly, I believe, because we lived there.
He is an amazingly clever man; his general knowledge is extraordinary.
He took various ’varsity scholarships and prizes at
Cambridge and was the ablest of the clever journalists with
whom Clement Shorter surrounded himself for his great move.
He may also fairly claim to be W. S. Gilbert’s successor as
a writer of really witty and scholarly songs (which have also
been amazingly popular) for the principal musical comedies
from <i>A Greek Slave</i> till the present day. Adrian Ross,
who is a Russian by birth, looks like a Russian with his big,
burly form, and fair beard and glasses, when you see him
taking the chair at some feast of reason like the Omar Khayyam
Club. He is one of the chief Omarians, and might, if
he devoted himself to it, write just such a poem as Fitzgerald’s
“Rubaiyat” himself, for he has the gift of form, the wit,
and the width of knowledge, to draw upon. In the same
way, if he had been born early enough, he would have written
some of our best ballades and rondeaux. There, in addition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>to his extraordinary facility, he had the advantage of being
one of the best-read men in England on French literature,
and one of the chief authorities upon it. He married Ethel
Wood, an actress as clever as she is pretty, who, if she
acted more, would be one of our most successful character-actresses.</p>

<p class='c016'>Rowland Thirlmere was another dual personality. When
he came to see us at Addison Mansions he was Rowland
Thirlmere the poet, literary to his finger-tips; when he was
at home at Bury he was John Walker, a Lancashire cotton-mill
manager, an ardent Conservative politician, a “Wake
up, England!” man. Did he not write <i>The Clash of Empires</i>,
a classic on the German peril?</p>

<p class='c016'>Douglas Ainslie, the poet of the Stuarts, who has now
established for himself a solid reputation in Philosophy, was
still a diplomat when he first used to come to see us.</p>

<p class='c016'>We had not so many poetesses. The chief of them was
Lady Lindsay, whose <i>In a Venetian Gondola</i> went through
many editions, a poetess of the same order and rank as the
Hon. Mrs. Norton a generation before. Her poetry was
strengthened by sincere piety and morality. They gave it
the mysterious quality which attracts us in the old Sienese
pictures.</p>

<p class='c016'>Among the younger poetesses who came to us, two stood
out—Ethel Clifford, Mrs. W. K. Clifford’s daughter, who
married Fisher Dilke, and Marguerite Radclyffe-Hall.</p>

<p class='c016'>The charm of Mrs. Dilke’s poetry is universally admitted,
but Miss Hall’s has not yet received anything like the recognition
which it deserves.</p>

<p class='c016'>She is a step-daughter of the famous musician, Albert
Visetti, and much younger than any of the others. To see
her, even to speak with her, one would think that she thought
more of her hunting-box and her horses than of abstractions
like poetry. At the time when I first met her, her winters
were equally divided between travelling and hunting, and
she appears to have gathered inspiration from both of these
sources. Her outdoor life in one of our most beautiful
counties has given her a deep love and appreciation of the
country pleasures only to be found in England. There is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>no one I know who writes more from inspiration. I reviewed
her first book, <i>’Twixt Earth and Stars</i>, with real enthusiasm.
Since then she has published <i>A Sheaf of Verses</i>, <i>Poems of the
Past and Present</i>, and <i>Songs of Three Counties and Other
Poems</i>. Of these three volumes, <i>Poems of the Past and
Present</i> shows her at her best.</p>

<p class='c016'>Visetti was born a Dalmatian, but he has for thirty years
been a British subject—and a very patriotic British subject.
He had the celebrated composer, Arrigo Boito, for a fellow-student
at the Conservatoire at Milan. An even greater
composer, Auber, introduced him to the splendid court of
the third Napoleon. Dumas père wrote a libretto for him.
He was Adelina Patti’s musical adviser for five years, and
wrote “La Diva” for her. He was admitted to the personal
friendship of both the late King Edward and the late Duke
of Edinburgh. He was the first professor appointed to the
staff of the Royal College of Music. He has written lives
of Palestrina and Verdi.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Dolly Radford,” a writer of delicate and sympathetic
verse, and her husband, Ernest Radford, used to come to
us in those days. So, very occasionally, did two Irish
poetesses, Mrs. Shorter and Katherine Tynan. The former,
wife of the editor of the <i>Sphere</i>, has won herself an assured
position by Celtic ballads of a highly imaginative order.
She is Yeats’s closest rival.</p>

<p class='c016'>I first met Mrs. Clement Shorter when she was staying
with Miss Katherine Tynan (Mrs. Hinkson) at Ealing, where
Shorter first met her. Mrs. Hinkson thus recalls Miss Dora
Sigerson, as she was then, in her <i>Reminiscences</i>—</p>

<p class='c016'>“I was the means of introducing Dora some years later to
Mr. Clement Shorter, whom she married.</p>

<p class='c016'>“We were all possessed with the common impulse towards
literature. We were all making our poems and stories. Dora
Sigerson, who was then a strikingly handsome girl, was
painting as well, making statuettes and busts, doing all sorts
of things, and looking like a young Muse. Dr. Sigerson was,
as he is happily doing to-day, dispensing the most delightful
hospitality. His Sunday-night dinners were, and are, a
feature of literary life in Dublin, chiefly of the literary life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>which has the colour of the green. At the time there was
no Irish Literary Society, as there is now, with Dr. Sigerson
for its President. The best of the young intellect of Dublin
was to be found at Dr. Sigerson’s board.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mrs. Shorter has written several volumes of poetry, one
with an introduction by George Meredith, novels and short
stories. She also still paints in oils, and models; her country
garden at Great Missenden has many examples of her talent
in this direction.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mrs. Shorter’s poetry has an ample range. Some of her
ballads are pitiful tragedies, told with a delicate sense of
ballad simplicity, and an exquisite ear for the broken music
which is so essential to ballads; and, at the other end of the
gamut, she can also write songs in a lighter vein that deserve
a composer like Bishop to set them to music—such songs as
the poem called “The Spies” in her <i>Madge Linsey</i> volume.</p>

<p class='c016'>Katherine Tynan, who had married H. A. Hinkson before
we ever met personally, though years earlier she had given
me introductions to Louise Imogen Guiney, the American
poetess, and other valued friends among the writers in America,
is the author of short lyrics, human and graceful, which ought
to find a permanent place in our anthologies, as well as a
popular novelist, and has lately written a charming volume
of her <i>Reminiscences</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>I have left Sir Edwin Arnold, Thomas Hardy and W. E.
Henley to the end of this chapter. Arnold, whom I used to
see daily when we were both living in Tokyo, was too infirm
to come to us much in Addison Mansions in his last days.</p>

<p class='c016'>While he was in Japan, he lived in a native house in Azabu
outside Treaty limits, receiving permission to do so under
the legal fiction that he was tutor to the daughters of the
wealthy Japanese who lent him the house under a similar
fiction. It was just outside the Azabu Temple, a favourite
resort for holiday-makers, and had delightful bamboo-brakes,
which rustled rhythm to Arnold in his garden.
The house had its proper paraphernalia of shifting wooden
and paper shutters, thick padded mats of primrose straw,
flat cushions to kneel on, flat quilts to sleep on, tobacco-stoves,
finger-stoves and kakemonos. It was so native that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>you always had to take off your boots when you went to see
him. Here he wrote the <i>Light of the World</i>, and he used to
read it to me batch by batch as he finished it. His manuscript
was most edifying; he wrote a beautiful scholarly
hand, full of character, rather like the hand of Lanfranc,
who was Archbishop of Canterbury in the reign of William
the Conqueror. He did very little sight-seeing or bargaining.
His time was taken up with receiving Buddhist abbots and
the sages who, by extraordinary abstinence and striking
concentrations of mind and will, had acquired supernatural
powers, just as Hall Caine used to see the leading Mohammedan
<i>ulema</i> in Egypt. They had a profound respect for
him. I always fancy that Arnold had in his mind some
<i>magnum opus</i> on those Eastern superhumans, which he never
gave to the world. He wrote a good deal of poetry in those
days besides the <i>Light of the World</i>, chiefly translations,
adaptations and imitations of the Hokku and other Japanese
forms of verse, in which he excelled. He not only had the
natural charm, he could put his mind on an Eastern plane
of thought. He looked quite Oriental when he was in
Japanese dress; his dark skin, his Oriental type, the deep
reserve which lay behind his affability, all suggested the child
of the East.</p>

<p class='c016'>Thomas Hardy (who honoured us with his presence very
rarely) I must mention in this context as a poet and not as
a novelist, though he is the head of the novelists’ craft to-day,
undoubtedly. I am not certain that he is not also our truest
living poet, except Kipling. He has certainly come nearer
to finding a new poetical form than any modern poet except
Yone Noguchi, the marvellous Japanese, who has written
some of the finest contemporary poetry in our language,
for Walt Whitman’s psalm forms are not suited for any
country but America, or for any writer who is not one of the
people working with his hands. His crudities would not be
tolerable in an educated man. But Hardy struck out entirely
fresh forms. Hardy shook off the ancient trammels of rhyme
and metre, while preserving a rich rhythm and a scholarly
elegance, in poems inspired with a broad humanity.</p>

<p class='c016'>Henley, who, like Gray, wrote a few gems, which will find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>their place in every anthology, was never in our flat at Addison
Mansions, though he was a friend of mine; he could not have
climbed so many stairs if he had tried.</p>

<p class='c016'>I remember two sayings of his specially. In those days
I wrote verses; and he was good enough to read my books of
verse and advise me on them. He said there was some hope
for me because I wrote short pieces, and, in his opinion, the
perfect poem should never contain more than three stanzas.
But I have long since abandoned verse writing.</p>

<p class='c016'>The other was a thing which he said to me when he was
giving me some introductions, on the eve of my departure for
America. I thought it was a joke then, but subsequent events
threw a light on it. He was urging me after I left America
to go on and see Stevenson at Samoa. He said that Stevenson
would be my inspiration, and as he was handing me the
introduction he said to me, with what I considered unnecessary
emphasis, “And when you see him, tell the beggar that
I hate him for being so beastly successful.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Years afterwards Henley wrote of Stevenson with an
acidity which his friends regretted very much, and which
proved to me that what he had said to me as we were parting
was one of those outbursts of candour for which Henley was
famous.</p>

<p class='c016'>It required a big man like Henley to confess that he was
envious, and perhaps there was good reason why he should
be, for considering the way their careers began, and Henley’s
magnificent intellect and gift of expression, one would not
have prophesied in the beginning that Henley would only
be appreciated by the critical few, and Stevenson by all the
world, gentle and simple.</p>

<p class='c016'>I never did see Stevenson. We meant to have taken Samoa
on our way back from Japan to San Francisco, but the
Japanese boat which should have taken us there broke down,
and we could not wait for the next.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <br /><span class='c022'>LADY AUTHORS AT ADDISON MANSIONS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>The</span> great “Miss Braddon,” who is now one of the most
valued of my friends, and a not infrequent visitor, never
came to 32 Addison Mansions. She achieved fame before
any living novelist. She had published <i>Aurora Floyd</i> and
<i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i> more than half a century ago, in 1862,
while Thomas Hardy did not write <i>Under the Greenwood
Tree</i> and <i>A Pair of Blue Eyes</i> till ten years after that. Her
powers are undiminished. Her <i>Green Curtain</i>, published
fifty years later, is one of the finest books she ever wrote.</p>

<p class='c016'>Nor did I ever meet Miss M. G. Tuttiett, who, since she
wrote her great <i>Silence of Dean Maitland</i>, has been known
to all the world as “Maxwell Gray,” until I became her
neighbour at Richmond. These lost years have deprived
me of a great pleasure, because, apart from my admiration
for her novels, I share two of her hobbies—her enthusiasm
for her garden and her enthusiasm for Italy.</p>

<p class='c016'>I used to esteem it an honour and a privilege when dear
old Mrs. Alexander—Mrs. Hector was her real name—used
to toil up the stairs to our parties. Her books were delightful,
and she was one of the earliest of my literary friends,
for I met her at Louise Chandler Moulton’s before I went to
America.</p>

<p class='c016'>Still more, on account of her infirmity, did I appreciate
it when Mrs. Lynn Linton came. My intimacy with her
arose from two facts. When my novel, <i>A Japanese Marriage</i>,
came out, she wrote to me in the warmest terms about it.
She not only was enthusiastic about it as a novel, but thought
it an unanswerable piece of advocacy for the relief of the
Deceased Wife’s Sister (now happily accomplished). After
that I was a frequent visitor at her flat in Queen Anne’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>Mansions, and later we met as fellow-guests at Malfitano,
the beautiful villa of Mr. and Mrs. J. J. S. Whitaker at
Palermo. She looked the grande dame, and she was a
great woman as well as a great writer, admired in both
capacities by all the great writers of her day, which was a
long one—long enough to include Walter Savage Landor.
Her championing of <i>A Japanese Marriage</i> came as a very
complete surprise to me, because she was noted for severity
as a moralist, and the marriage of the hero and the heroine
by the American Consul, after the clergy had refused to
marry them, in the eye of the Law was no marriage at all,
since neither of them was an American subject—it was a
mere manifesto that they meant to live together as man and
wife. That letter of hers was the beginning of one of my
most delightful friendships.</p>

<p class='c016'>I don’t remember when I first met Mrs. Croker or Mrs.
Perrin or Flora Annie Steel, though they have all been
valued friends for many years. As they are all Anglo-Indians,
I suppose that I must have met one of them through
some member of my family in the Indian Army or Indian
Civil Service, and the others through her. My family have
been much connected with India. To mention only two of
them, my cousin, General John Sladen, was a brother-in-law
of Lord Roberts, and actually kept house with him in India
for a year, and his brother, Sir Edward Sladen, was the
British resident who played so great a part in Burmah, and
whose statue has the place of honour in the Burmese capital.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of one thing I am certain, that the marriage of Mrs.
Croker’s beautiful daughter—the belle of Dublin—to one
of the Palermo Whitakers, was not the introduction, for
Mrs. Croker has never been to Palermo, and I remember her
asking me all about the Whitakers’ famous gardens in Sicily.
Captain Whitaker did not live there; he was with his
regiment.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is natural to mention Mrs. Steel, Mrs. Perrin and Mrs.
Croker together, for they long divided the Indian Empire
with Rudyard Kipling as a realm of fiction. Each in her
own department is supreme.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the days when we first knew her, and she was living
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>in Ireland, it used to be like a ray of sunshine when pretty
Mrs. Croker, with her blue eyes and her bright colour and
her delightful Irish tongue, paid one of her rare visits to
London. As I write these words, I am about to pay a visit
to her in her Folkestone home. She is exactly the type you
would expect from her irresistible books.</p>

<p class='c016'>When I asked Mrs. Croker what first gave her the idea of
writing, she said—</p>

<p class='c016'>“My very first attempt at writing was in the hot weather
at Secunderabad. When my husband was away tiger-shooting,
and I was more or less a prisoner all day owing
to the heat, I began a story, solely for my own amusement.
It grew day by day, and absorbed all my time and interest.
This was <i>Proper Pride</i>. With reluctance and trepidation
I read it to a friend, and then to all the other ladies in the
regiment—under seal of secrecy. Emboldened by this
success, I wrote <i>Pretty Miss Neville</i>, and when I returned
home with the Royal Scots Fusiliers, I had two manuscripts
among my luggage. These went the usual round, but at
the end of a year I received a small offer for <i>Proper Pride</i>.
It came out in August 1892, without my name, and was
immediately successful—principally owing to long and
appreciative notices in <i>The Times</i> and <i>Saturday Review</i>,
both on the same day. Three editions went off in a month,
and I must confess that no one was as much surprised by
this success as I was. Subsequently I sold the copyright of
<i>Pretty Miss Neville</i> for one hundred pounds, and though now
a lady of thirty, she still sells, in cheap editions. I attribute
my good fortune to the fact that my novels struck a new
note—India and army society—and that I received very
powerful help from unknown reviewers. I like writing,
otherwise I could not work. I believe I inherit the taste
from my father’s family, who were said to be ‘born with a
pen in their hands’!” Mrs. Croker tells me that it was I
who first introduced her to London literary society. I consider
this one of the most charming successes of my literary
career.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mrs. Perrin, on the other hand, since she came back from
India, has played a continuously prominent part in London
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>literary life. She has been a leading figure at literary clubs
and receptions, and has been a pillar of “the Women
Journalists.” As story-teller and psychologist combined,
she has no superior. Those of her wide public who know her
in private life know a brilliant and charming woman of the
world, with a proved capacity for managing literary affairs.</p>

<p class='c016'>When I asked Mrs. Perrin what started her in a literary
career, she said—</p>

<p class='c016'>“I think I took to writing from sheer need of occupation.
When I married my husband in India, as a girl of eighteen,
we were sent to a place in the jungle where he had charge
of an enormous aqueduct which was under construction.
He had several Coopers Hill assistants under him, not one
of whom was married, and I was the only English woman
in the locality. There was no station—or permanent settlement;
our houses were temporary erections of mud, and
we were miles from the railway. The landscape consisted
of a sea of yellow grass about the height of a man, and there
was only one road, which lay behind our bungalow—the
grand trunk road that is the backbone of India. I began
to write here, just to amuse myself, and then when we went
to less isolated spots, I gained confidence and used to send
little articles and turn-overs to the <i>Pioneer</i>—the principal
Indian daily paper. These were nearly always accepted,
and so I took courage and wrote a novel called <i>Into
Temptation</i>, which ran through that prehistoric magazine
<i>London Society</i>, long ago defunct. The book came out in
two volumes and had very fair notices. Then I wrote
another called <i>Late in Life</i>, which ran serially in an Indian
weekly, off-shoot of the <i>Pioneer</i>, and in England through
the <i>Belgravia</i>, and then came out in two volumes. So you
may imagine—or rather, realise—how long ago I began!
Both these novels are now to appear revised and corrected
in Messrs. Methuen’s 7<i>d.</i> series.</p>

<p class='c016'>“However, I did not receive the financial encouragement
I had hoped for from these first efforts, and I lost heart.
For nearly ten years I wrote nothing but a few Indian short
stories. Then when my husband was offered an appointment
at home, and we retired before we had ‘done’ our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>full time in India, I collected these stories, and they came
out under the title of <i>East of Suez</i>. The book was a success
and since then I have written and have been published
steadily.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I am deeply interested in India, in the people and their
religions, and histories and social systems, and as I was
sixteen years in the country I had an opportunity of receiving
lasting impressions, and of gaining invaluable experience.
I come of a family which has been officially connected with
India for five generations. My great grandfather was with
Lord Cornwallis, on his staff, at the taking of Seringapatam,
and the surrender to Lord Cornwallis of Tippoo Sahib’s two
little sons as hostages. He was afterwards Chairman of the
old East India Company—known in those days as John
Company.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I cannot think of anything more anecdotal in my
experience as a novelist—I can only remember the disappointments
and the difficulties of what success I have
made, at which, perhaps, I may now bring myself to smile,
but I do not think they would be interesting if related!”</p>

<p class='c016'>A few years ago Mrs. Steel was also one of the most
prominent figures in London literary society. She had
written <i>On the Face of the Waters</i>, one of the finest historical
novels in the language; she was a hard and earnest worker
in all sorts of movements, and as a fighting speaker there
were few to match her. She could make a good set speech,
but her set speeches were nothing to the oratory of which
she was capable if, when she was totally unprepared, indignation
stung her into springing to her feet to denounce
the offender. Then her words came as blows come from a
man who hits another man because he is incensed beyond
endurance. A face full of life and expression added force
to her words.</p>

<p class='c016'>Since Mrs. Steel settled down on an estate in Wales, she
has been little in London. But in those days she had a
sort of country house on the Notting Hill slope of Campden
Hill. She is a keen politician, and not long ago sold the
opening page of <i>On the Face of the Waters</i> as her subscription
to the Women’s Cause.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>Another author lost to London is Sarah Grand. She used
to be our neighbour; she shared a flat in the Abingdon Road
with her step-son, Haldane McFall, the art critic, and author
of that remarkable novel, <i>The Wooings of Jezebel Pettyfer</i>.
I met her soon after the success of <i>The Heavenly Twins</i>—a
young woman with indignant blue eyes, very reserved, but
with a rare charm of manner behind her reserve. I was
introduced to her, I think, by Heinemann, who was often
at our at-homes. He had, as I understood, purchased <i>The
Heavenly Twins</i> from her ready printed, copyright and all
for a hundred pounds, but when the success came had torn
up the agreement, and substituted a royalty agreement,
paying the royalties from the beginning. She had already,
I gathered, received twelve times the original sum in royalties.</p>

<p class='c016'>Alfred Walford often came to see us—his wife, Mrs. L. B.
Walford, more occasionally, since she was the mother of a
large family as well as many books, and they lived in Essex.
Alfred Walford used to chaff himself about his connection
with literature being to produce the paper on which it was
printed. He was a paper-maker; and she, at that time,
was the favourite novelist of the Colonies. She was the
daughter of that Colquhoun of Luss who wrote that famous
book <i>The Moor and the Loch</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>The gentle-faced “Miss Thackeray,” the great novelist’s
daughter, now the widow of Sir Richmond Ritchie, I did not
know in those days, but I used to meet her afterwards at
Lady Lindsay’s. There was a time when her <i>Old Kensington</i>
was my favourite novel.</p>

<p class='c016'>And here I must say something about my old and dear
friend, Lady Lindsay, who has so recently passed away, and
whose lameness prevented her from toiling up the stairs to
our at-homes very often. For many years I was constantly
at her house, both at her famous dinner-parties and running
in to have a talk about books when I was sure of finding her
alone, for she was good enough to be much interested in my
work.</p>

<div id='i124f'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i124f.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“MISS BRADDON”<br /><i>Drawn by Yoshio Markino</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The daughter of a Cabinet Minister, the Right Hon.
Henry Fitzroy (son of the first Lord Southampton), a
descendant of Nathan Meyer de Rothschild, who founded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>the fortunes of his House, and sister-in-law of the Loyd
Lindsay, V.C., who became Lord Wantage, she knew nearly
every noted person of her time, and those whom she did not
know, she generally could have known but for some prejudice
against them. At her dinner-parties you met men like
Tennyson and Gladstone and Layard of Nineveh—great
politicians, great nobles, great authors, great painters, but
hardly any one from the theatrical world. I was nearly
always the least important person present. Eight was her
favourite number, though sometimes there were a dozen
at her famous round table. The conversation used to be
brilliant; the company was arranged with a view to that—naturally
the chief guest often got possession of the table,
and we sat and chronicled the historic scene in our hearts.</p>

<p class='c016'>Afterwards, when one went up into the drawing-room,
our eyes rested on pictures by Sandro Botticelli and Titian,
sixteenth-century Italian wedding-chests, and other inheritances
of the great. She wrote more than one volume
of poems which went into several editions.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is natural to mention beside her another great lady who
was in touch with all the notabilities of her time, Walpole’s
descendant, Lady Dorothy Nevill, who married a descendant
of Warwick the Kingmaker’s elder brother, the Baron of Abergavenny.
Her husband was at one time the heir-presumptive
of the Marquis of Abergavenny. She happily gave her
reminiscences to the world, as Lady Lindsay always meant
to do, so readers know her connections, though she was too
modest to show how Disraeli leaned upon her advice. Among
the most interesting things which I remember in her house
in Charles Street, Berkeley Square, were the unique mementoes
of her ancestor, the tremendous Sir Robert Walpole, the
Asquith of the eighteenth century. It was she who told me
that Nelson was called Horatio because Horace Walpole
presented his father to the living of Burnham Thorpe, which
is still in the gift of the Earls of Orford.</p>

<p class='c016'>Lady St. Helier, another great London hostess, at whose
house I have met some of the most celebrated people of the
day—Lady St. Helier and her daughter, Mrs. Allhusen, never
came to see us till we had left Addison Mansions for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Avenue House, Richmond. No woman has been more
integrally a part of the life of her time than Lady St. Helier,
who wrote an admirable volume of reminiscences. Mrs.
Allhusen has the inspiration of owning a house where one of
the masterpieces of literature was written—Gray’s <i>Elegy</i>.
For the house in which Gray wrote it after the inspiration,
which came to him as he was leaning over the gate of Stoke
Poges Churchyard, has been enlarged into Stoke Court, and
the room in which Gray wrote out the <i>Elegy</i> forms part of
Mrs. Allhusen’s writing-room.</p>

<p class='c016'>Marie Corelli, like Hall Caine, has a dislike of literary
receptions. I cannot remember if she ever came to Addison
Mansions, though we have been friends for many years, and
I remember going to brilliant dinner-parties at her house
in Longridge Road. Her stepfather, Charles Mackay, who
adopted her, was one of my earliest literary friends.</p>

<p class='c016'>Her stepbrother, Eric Mackay, author of the famous
<i>Love-letters of a Violinist</i>, lived with her, and he came to our
at-homes so frequently that I think she must have come with
him sometimes. They were a very musical family. It is
always said that Marie Corelli, had she so chosen, could have
won as much fame in music as she has in literature. Her
books illustrate Hall Caine’s axiom that the greatest novels
are those which deal with the elemental facts of human
nature. Her grasp of human nature has won her countless
readers in both hemispheres.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is not universally known that Marie Corelli is an
admirable speaker—so lucid, so convincing, able by perfect
elocution to reach the furthest corner of the large hall of
the Hotel Cecil without raising her voice. Though she
lives at Stratford-on-Avon, and is identified with all its
functions, she is frequently to be seen in London at places
like Ranelagh or dancing at the great balls at the Albert
Hall.</p>

<p class='c016'>Almost alone of the chief lady novelists of that time,
Mrs. Humphry Ward was never at Addison Mansions.
The most interesting thing I remember in conversation with
her was her confession to me one day when we were at Mrs.
W. K. Clifford’s that she enjoys handling the character of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>person who is a failure better than the character of a person
who achieves success. Heroes apparently do not appeal to
her.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mrs. W. K. Clifford was often at Addison Mansions. She
is a very old friend of mine, and a great personality. Mrs.
Clifford is an admirable example of the modern woman,
breezy, wholesome, warm-hearted, clear-visioned, lucid in
expression, interested in all questions of the day, and withal
one of our best novelists. Early in life she suffered a
loss which would have overwhelmed most women, for she
lost her husband, Prof. W. K. Clifford, F.R.S., who was
already reckoned the third mathematician in Europe, at the
same age as Wolfe fell at Quebec, thirty-three, when they
had only been married four years, and she was still a girl.
He was the most brilliant Fellow of Trinity (Cambridge) of
his day, and the youngest Fellow of the Royal Society.
There is nothing he could not have done and would not have
done if he had lived, for there was no side of life which did
not appeal to him. People of every rank and of every shade
of thought came to see him, and no matter how little they
agreed with him, they were always hypnotised for the hour.</p>

<p class='c016'>He had wonderful dark-lashed blue eyes, like his daughter,
and a wonderful soul seemed to be looking out of them.</p>

<p class='c016'>But she did not allow her loss to prostrate her, and she
has lived to see her house one of the Meccas of literature
in London, and her daughter, Mrs. Fisher Dilke, a recognised
poetess.</p>

<p class='c016'>Talking of Mrs. Clifford reminds me of the chequered
career of <i>The Love-letters of a Worldly Woman</i>. It was
published just twenty years ago, and though the first edition
sold out immediately, no second edition was published in
England, but in America, where it was non-copyright, it
sold enormously. There were a dozen pirate editions of it,
including a marked edition, which means one with the most
popular passages indicated. Such a height of popularity did
it reach that it was actually sold at street-corners in New
York! But I have heard that Mrs. Clifford only got fifteen
pounds royalties off the whole dozen editions.</p>

<p class='c016'>The first batch of love-letters in this volume appeared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>anonymously in the <i>Fortnightly</i>, and were generally attributed
to Oscar Wilde. As a piece of poetical justice when Housman’s
<i>An English-woman’s Love-letters</i> were published seven
years later, they were attributed to Mrs. Clifford. <i>The Love-letters
of a Worldly Woman</i> was a remarkable book, and fully
deserved its American popularity.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mrs. Clifford is, above all things, an idealist and a lover
of good work. She has said, in one of her books, “in good
love and good work lie the chance of immortality for everything
that is worth having or being; and yet, though I’ve
aimed at the sun, and longed to put into the beautiful world
something worthy of it, I have never hit higher than a gooseberry
bush, or achieved anything that gave me satisfaction.
And I’ve been so full of enthusiasms and dreams ... perhaps
one of the dreams will come true some day—who knows?
For if I live to be ninety, I shall still feel, as I do now, that
the soul of me is as young and fresh as ever; and it is a sense
of the beauty of things, of the kindness that underlies human
nature, even when it’s choked with weeds at the top, that
gives one courage, and helps one to do.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Beside Mrs. Clifford I should mention Margaret Woods,
whom I first met when I was an undergraduate at Oxford,
and her husband, the present Master of the Temple, was my
tutor, engaged to her while I was his pupil. I remember
his asking me and other undergraduates to meet her in his
rooms. I do not think he told us why, but we knew. She
was one of the few charming women that the monastic
Oxford of that day contained. Her father, afterwards the
famous Dean of Westminster, was master of University
College; I used to go to his Socrates lectures. He was dissatisfied
with the progress we were making, and boldly—it
was very bold at Oxford—charged us with paying too much
attention to athletics, and it was then that he made his
famous mot, that he had never taken any exercise in his life,
except by occasionally standing up when he was reading.
I have heard that it is equally true of Mr. Chamberlain, but
it was Dean Bradley who said it. The Bradleys were an
excessively clever family. The Dean had a brother or a half-brother
a great philosopher, a don at Merton, and another,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Andrew Bradley, a Fellow at Balliol, who became Professor
of Literature at another University. I forget what his sister,
Emma Bradley, did, but she was famous. Three of his
daughters, Mrs. Woods, Mrs. Birchenough, Mrs. Murray
Smith, are authoresses, Mrs. Woods being one of the best
novelists of the day, and in my opinion the best of all poetesses
in the English language. When Tennyson died there was a
movement in favour of her being made the laureate, and no
woman has ever had such claims for the post. She made
her mark very young with <i>A Village Tragedy</i> and <i>Esther
Vanhomrigh</i>, and has written notable books ever since.
Beautiful workmanship, singularly broad humanity, and
truth to life are the characteristics of her prose. In poetry
she has the gifts of both Brownings. She lives in an ideal
home, the panelled Master’s House at the Temple, which
has, however, one drawback, that the only way out of it to
a cab on a wet night is to be carried in a sedan chair; a
sedan chair of the eighteenth century is kept in the hall for
the purpose, and passes from one Master of the Temple to
another.</p>

<p class='c016'>Charles Kingsley’s daughter, Mrs. St. Leger Harrison—the
“Lucas Malet” of fame—used to come to us sometimes
before she went back to live at Eversley, immortalised by her
father; and once her cousin, the famous African explorer, the
other Mary Kingsley, came. Lucas Malet is all that one
might expect of Charles Kingsley’s daughter and the writer
of <i>Sir Richard Calmady</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>It seems natural to mention the author of <i>Concerning
Isabel Carnaby</i> beside the author of <i>Sir Richard Calmady</i>.
The two books made a stir about the same time, and the
public mixed their titles with great impartiality. The
author of the former, Ellen Thorneycroft Fowler, now the
Hon. Mrs. Felkin, with her sister, Edith Fowler, was a good
many times at Addison Mansions. I have told the story of
her becoming an authoress in my chapter on the Idlers and
Vagabonds.</p>

<p class='c016'>I should have mentioned Beatrice Harraden before. When
you see this small, slight, delicate-looking woman, with her
bright eyes, you are forcibly reminded of the invalid heroine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>of <i>Ships that Pass in the Night</i>. But Beatrice Harraden is a
public school woman; she was at Cheltenham College—the
ladies’ College—and has taken the liveliest interest in all
the interests of women since. She was cured, I fancy, of
some pulmonary disease by going to California. She now
has one of the most unique flats in Hampstead. I do not
remember how I met her, but it was a long time ago, and I
was very elated, because I always thought <i>Ships that Pass
in the Night</i> one of the best-written short novels in the
language.</p>

<p class='c016'>Helen Mathers has for many years been a dear friend of
ours. She was another of the authors whose acquaintance
it elated me to make. Although she is much about the
same age as myself, she made her two successes with <i>Comin’
Through the Rye</i> and <i>Cherry Ripe</i> when I was a boy at school.
Her husband, Henry Reeves, the eminent orthopædist, was
one of the very first doctors to make practical use of the
X-rays. She had a son in the army who promised to be
her worthy successor in literature had he lived, as the writing
which he achieved proved. Her real name was Mathews.
She was a cousin of the Estella Mathews who married my
near neighbour, George Cave, K.C., M.P., who was in my
team, as was Mr. Justice Montague Shearman, when I was
Captain of the Public Schools Football Club at Oxford, and
who now occasionally plays golf with me when he can get
a day off from the Courts, and from the case against Home
Rule.</p>

<p class='c016'>Frances Hodgson Burnett I first met in Washington, where
she was the wife of a well-known doctor, and the mother of
two beautiful boys in velvet Patience suits, locally called
Fauntleroy suits, in honour of her book <i>Little Lord Fauntleroy</i>.
But she was not an American; she was an Englishwoman
born in Manchester, who had made her fame with a book
about the north of England, called <i>That Lass o’ Lowrie’s</i>.
Eventually she came back to live in her native England, first
of all in a house in Portland Place and afterwards in a manor
house in Kent. Her gigantic success with books and plays
did not turn her head; she was always the same gracious
human woman she had been when she was making her way.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>John Oliver Hobbes, on the other hand, though she lived
so much in England, and wrote all her books over here, was
an American-born, the daughter of John Morgan Richards,
who was at one time Chairman of the American Society in
London, and had as much to do with <i>entente cordiale</i> between
England and the United States as any American Ambassador
at the Court of St. James’. He was, as it were, a sort of
social ambassador. The great house in Lancaster Gate in
which he lived till he retired from business was a focus of
entertainment for both branches of the Anglo-Saxon race.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mrs. Craigie was a friend of our present Queen. She was
extraordinarily clever and extraordinarily charming. She
always gave every one to whom she was talking the knowledge
that for the time being nobody else existed for her.
In intellect she was the equal of any contemporary woman
writer; added to this, she was very pretty, very engaging,
very well dressed, and certainly proved the truth of the
proverb “Whom the gods love, die young.” She had the
gift of bringing out the wit as well as the best qualities of
others.</p>

<p class='c016'>Another American authoress who has spent most of her
life and done all her writing in England is Irene Osgood,
who came here as a very beautiful young bride of fabulous
wealth, and rented a house which was one of the shrines of
English literature—Knebworth, the home of Bulwer Lytton.
She did not write <i>Servitude</i>, the book by which she will be
remembered, there, but at Guilsborough, in Northamptonshire,
another seat which she took for the hunting.</p>

<p class='c016'>Yet another American authoress, who was also young and
beautiful when she came to England, was Amelie Rives, who
was at that time wife of J. A. Chanler, a great-grandson of
the original Astor, but is now Princess Troubetzkoi. The
daughter of a Virginian country gentleman, she simply leapt
into fame with a book called <i>Virginia of Virginia</i>, which
took the Americans by storm. She was irresistibly clever,
and very striking-looking, with her pale gold hair, clear
dusky complexion, and big blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c016'>Gertrude Franklin Atherton, a remarkable-looking Californian
with the same pale gold hair and rather the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>complexion as Amelie Rives, whose mother was a great-grandniece
of Benjamin Franklin, was at one time a very
frequent visitor of ours. She was a long time getting her
recognition, and then suddenly leapt into her full fame.
But those who used to meet her socially knew from the first
that she was a woman of commanding intellect. She had
an odd trick of wearing a quill thrust through her hair.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. and Mrs. C. N. Williamson are among my oldest
literary friends. I made Williamson’s acquaintance when
he was sub-editor of the <i>Graphic</i>, and asked me to write an
illustrated article on Adam Lindsay Gordon. Alice Livingston
was an American girl, who came over to England to
spend a year with some friends, and has never been back in
her own country for more than three months at a time since.
She had a letter of introduction to C. N. Williamson, who
introduced her to a number of London editors, and thus
gave her a chance of success in story-writing. After their
marriage she wrote many serial stories, some of which appeared
in book form; but the first great “Williamson
success” was <i>The Lightning Conductor</i>, suggested by their
earliest motoring adventures in France and Italy. C. N.
Williamson having expert knowledge as a mechanical
engineer (he intended to be one, before he determined to
become a writer), it was easy to mingle amusing mechanical
details of motoring with the story, a feature which appealed
to lovers of automobiles in the days, ten or eleven years ago,
when the sport was an uncertain adventure.</p>

<p class='c016'>They both love story-telling—Mrs. Williamson used to
“print” stories when she was six years old, before she could
write—and have written a good many popular travel novels
since <i>The Lightning Conductor</i>. They love also to see the
far corners of the world, though they contrive to spend two
or three months each winter in their Riviera house, and a
month or two in summer among their friends in London.</p>

<p class='c016'>Next to travelling, they love to build houses, and make
them beautiful. If they see some land on a hillside with a
splendid view, they can hardly resist buying it, and planning
exactly the sort of house which ought to exist there. This
means that they sell their last house, and begin another,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>with a different sort of garden, but there must always be a
bull-dog in it, rejoicing in the name of Tiberius, or “Tibe.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Madame Albanesi, one of the most successful novelists of
the day, and wife of the well-known musician, is an old
friend of ours. She had long been one of the most successful
writers of serial fiction in popular journals, but it was not
until after her marriage with Signor Albanesi that she turned
her attention to novels—one of the earliest of these books
receiving remarkable reviews. She conceived the idea of
advertising these reviews herself, with the result that she was
approached by a number of leading publishers for her next
book, and happily followed with the book which established
her name—<i>Susannah and One Other</i>, a book which has been
running for over ten years, and is still selling. The book-reading
public only required to have its attention adequately
drawn to her novels, to see what admirable stories they
were—faithful to life, pulsing with human nature.</p>

<p class='c016'>I asked Madame Albanesi what first made her write. She
said that she could not remember when she had not tried to
write in some form or other, and that happily for her, when
she was quite a girl circumstances threw her into a circle
where her gift of imaginative writing was warmly encouraged,
and opportunities were found for turning this gift to the most
satisfactory results. I remember Madame Albanesi telling
me that an interesting fact in connection with her earlier
writing was that her imagination was so fertile that she
used—before she was twenty years old—to keep three or
four serials running at the same time. She never had less
than two going at once, and wrote them in instalments from
week to week, and never took a note. Everything was
published anonymously, and a new serial would begin before
the old one was finished. Madame Albanesi regards her
serial work as being the very best training for telling a good
story.</p>

<p class='c016'>I ought to have mentioned earlier, since she belonged to
that generation, John Strange Winter, a shining light in
Bohemia at the epoch of which I am writing. She made
her first success when I was at Oxford, with <i>Bootles’ Baby</i>,
and <i>Hoop-la</i>, but she had lost her vogue before we went to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>live at Addison Mansions, though her name remained a household
word, and she continued to publish a number of popular
books. She was then living in an old house at Merton near
Wimbledon, but shortly afterwards came to live at West
Kensington, because she found Merton too far out.</p>

<p class='c016'>She was a woman of inexhaustible energy, and had a
very kind heart. She was exceedingly good to young
authors and journalists; she made their cause her own;
she welcomed them to her house, and visited theirs. She
was a sister-in-law of George Augustus Sala. She was unfortunate
in losing her public; she would have it again if she
were alive now. But at that time a wave of preciousness and
morbidness, which left her stranded, was passing over the
country.</p>

<p class='c016'>“George Egerton” and “Roy Devereux,” very pretty and
clever women, were at the top of that wave among women,
the former with books like <i>Keynotes</i>, the latter, and George
Egerton’s beautiful sister, Miss Dunne, with brilliant and
virile journalism in the <i>Saturday Review</i>, the <i>Pall Mall</i> and
elsewhere. Lane was their publisher, Beardsley was their
illustrator, H. G. Wells headed the list of their male rivals,
followed by Arthur Machen, H. D. Lowry and others. I
have all their books—such slim books for novels. Fisher
Unwin had another school of them, headed by John Oliver
Hobbes, as daring from the sex point of view, but lighter in
touch, which he published in long slim books with yellow
paper covers at eighteenpence each. <i>Some Emotions and
a Moral</i> came out in this series, which I heard some one ask
for at Smith’s Library quite seriously as <i>Some Morals and a
Reputation</i>. These were Wells’s <i>Time Machine</i>, <i>Stolen Bacillus</i>,
and <i>Wonderful Visit</i> days.</p>

<p class='c016'>I asked George Egerton, who was in camp at Tauranga
during the Maori war as an infant, and as a child was in
her uncle Admiral Bynon’s fleet while he was bombarding
Valparaiso, and who I knew was intended for an artist, what
had made her turn writer. She told me—</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why I wrote? Because I had to. Why I wrote as I
did? Because I felt woman could only hope to do one thing
in literature—put <i>herself</i> into it. Write not in breeches, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>in corsets. That I took the name of George Egerton was
partly because I did not think any publisher would take
stories of that kind written by a woman, partly to see if my
sex would make itself felt. <i>Keynotes</i> went into seven languages
in two years. I am not dead abroad. At the Goethe
Centenary in Weimar the Dr. Professor who gave the lecture
on literature of the century, spoke of Rudyard Kipling and
George Egerton as the two who had introduced a new note,
a new method, into English literature ‘in our time.’</p>

<p class='c016'>“I gave up writing books when I found that authors are
‘unsecured creditors’—not worth the candle unless one can
reel off popular stuff. I can’t. I go to America with plays.
I make any money I make there. I shall arrive here too.
I am doing a big book now, and I am starting a book of
recollections. If one attaches credence to the fortune-tellers,
I am to live to be an old woman. It might be amusing,
if only to demolish the men and women of straw one has seen
lauded to the skies, in one’s memory.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Marie Belloc, who had not then married Lowndes of <i>The
Times</i>, was a constant visitor. She belonged very much to
the Idler and Vagabond set of which we saw so much, and
was already longing to write novels, though many years were
to go by before she was able to fulfil her wish. She is a sister
of Hilaire Belloc, the free-lance M.P. of the last Parliament,
one of the wittiest writers of the day, who has the further
distinction of having been a driver in a French artillery
regiment and a Scholar of Balliol afterwards. It should
be added that he was twenty-three when he went up to
Oxford.</p>

<p class='c016'>Marie Stuart Boyd, of the same set, the wife of the well-known
<i>Punch</i> and <i>Graphic</i> artist, did not begin to publish
her delightful books till nearly ten years later, though she
was a regular contributor to important Reviews.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mrs. Frankau (“Frank Danby”), who came with her
sister, Mrs. Aria, had at that time dropped writing for engraving,
and did not resume it till some years later. <i>Pigs in
Clover</i>, and her other successes in fiction, belong to a much
later date.</p>

<p class='c016'>One of the most daring and witty of women writers, Violet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>Hunt, was constantly at our at-homes. With a father who
was a well-known artist, a Fellow of Corpus Christi, Oxford,
and a friend of Gladstone’s, and a mother who wrote novels
of repute; and brought up in the brilliant set which gathered
round Burne-Jones and Ford Madox Brown, it was no wonder
that she should be extraordinarily clever, and no one was
surprised when she produced scintillating books like <i>The
Maiden’s Progress</i> and <i>A Hard Woman</i>. South Lodge, their
house on Campden Hill, was a Mecca for distinguished
literary people. It was there that I first met Andrew Lang,
Robert Hichens, Somerset Maugham, Katherine Cecil
Thurston in a crowd of writers of high calibre. It was one
of the few houses where Lang was natural without being
rude.</p>

<p class='c016'>I now come to a group of able women writers whom I
met at clubs like the Pioneers and the Writers’, though they
mostly came often to our at-homes afterwards. First
among them I may place that brilliant and delightful writer,
Mrs. Alfred Sidgwick, who published her early novels under
the pseudonym of “Mrs. Andrew Dean.” Her husband,
Mr. Alfred Sidgwick, is the author of well-known works on
logic, and one of the earliest of the modern school of philosophers,
known as the Pragmatists. He is a cousin of Mr.
Henry Sidgwick (d. 1900), the distinguished Professor of
Moral Philosophy at Cambridge, who married Mr. A. J.
Balfour’s sister, the guardian spirit of Newnham.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mrs. Sidgwick’s novels have always been full of verve.
She has steeped herself in the literature of three countries,
and until she married knew the world better from the
Continental point of view than from the English. But her
marriage took her amongst English people, so that she has
had unusual opportunities of understanding two nationalities
intimately. In those days we saw a good deal of her because
she lived at Surbiton, but for many years past she has lived
in Cornwall.</p>

<p class='c016'>At the same club I met Miss Montrésor, whose delicate
health has prevented her seeing much of London literary
society, though she lives in South Kensington. With her
<i>Into the Highways and Hedges</i> she leapt into fame at a single
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>bound. Miss Montrésor is a genius. Her intuition enables
her to describe with fidelity phases of life with which she
cannot have had any acquaintance. When she wrote <i>Into
the Highways and Hedges</i>, my friend Sheldon, who was the
London manager of D. Appleton &amp; Co., gave me five
pounds to write a careful opinion of it, to see whether his
firm, to whom it had been offered, should publish it or not.
I gave them a long opinion, in which I told them that they
could not possibly refuse such a book. But they did refuse
it, because almost any American publisher will refuse any
novel which is not by a novelist who has already made a
great name. Some other New York firm took it, and it
was the book of the year in America.</p>

<p class='c016'>At a club, too, I met Annie Swan (whose husband, Dr.
Burnett Smith, was last year Mayor of Hertford), twenty
years and more ago, a woman completely unspoiled by
success, which came to her early and without stint, and
remained. She stands at the very head of the writers of the
wholesome school of fiction. In those days she lived at
Hampstead, in a house called “Aldersyde,” after the novel
which gave her her fame. She is one of those people whose
obvious sincerity charms you the moment you meet them.
I don’t know whether she is interested in spiritualism, but
I did on one occasion meet Florence Marryat and Dora
Russell together at her table.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of Florence Marryat (Mrs. Francis Lean), the daughter of
the immortal Captain Marryat, I saw a good deal at one
time. She was a very regular attendant at a dining club
called the Argonauts, which Frankfort Moore and I got up
because the Vagabonds would not then admit ladies to their
banquets. Spiritualism played an immense part in her life.
She was also a very voluminous writer. I remember her
telling me that she had written more than seventy novels.
She was a tall, striking-looking woman, whose eyes suggested
intimacy with the occult.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Leightons, who are among my most valued friends, I
certainly met at some club—Marie Leighton is the best
newspaper serial writer of the day—a story-teller born, and,
like her husband, a great authority on dogs. One at any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>rate of her thrilling stories has been dramatised and others
are sure to follow, as the managers of the melodrama theatres
recognise how immensely dramatic her stories are.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Lucas Cleeve,” another frequent visitor at our house,
wife of Colonel Kingscote, and daughter of Sir Henry
Drummond Wolff, M.P., who made with Mr. Balfour, Lord
Randolph Churchill, and Sir John Gorst the celebrated
Fourth Party, had an extraordinary facility for writing
novels of a certain merit, and, like her father, was a great
linguist and traveller. Sir John Gorst introduced me to
her. I met him at Castle Combe, which now belongs to him,
and then belonged to his brother, the late Edward Chadwick
Lowndes. I was staying with my brother-in-law, Robert
Watkins, the agent of the estate, which is one of historical
interest, for its archives prove it to have been irretrievably
wasted by Sir John Fastolfe, Knt., Shakespeare’s Falstaff,
who had married the widow of the last of its Scroop owners,
and managed the estate for her. He built the chancel
arches in the church, fine and early Perpendicular. The
Scroop and Falstaff house has long since disappeared, while
the Cromlech of a British Chief, and a Roman Camp, continue
almost perfect. I was often the guest of Sir John’s eldest
son, Sir Eldon, when I was in Egypt, and his younger son,
Harold, and his charming wife, have been our intimate
friends for many years. Mrs. Harold Gorst, who was a Miss
Kennedy of the famous Shrewsbury School family of scholars,
has an extraordinary knowledge of the life of the poor in
London, and her novels reflect it with a fidelity which should
have won them ten times their circulation.</p>

<p class='c016'>Quite a prominent place among the authoresses who used
to assemble on those evenings at Addison Mansions is occupied
by novelists who began as my secretaries, and whom I
trained to write.</p>

<p class='c016'>I have been singularly fortunate in my choice of them.
Not only have they given me so much satisfaction as secretaries
that I have only had to send one away for inefficiency,
and none for any other reason, but they have made such
good use of the opportunities they had for observing the
ways of book-writing, that in the twenty-seven years since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>the first came to me, they have between them had more
than twenty-seven books published and paid for by leading
firms like Hutchinson, Heinemann, Methuen, Hurst &amp;
Blackett, Constable &amp; Co., Chatto &amp; Windus, Eveleigh
Nash, Mills &amp; Boon and Stanley Paul.</p>

<p class='c016'>My first secretary was Norma Lorimer, who came to us
in her teens, before our memorable journey to America,
Canada and the Far East. She has accompanied us on
every important journey we ever made in Europe, Asia,
Africa and America since I returned from Australia. When
typewriting came in, she ceased to be my secretary, because
she was never a typist, but she continued to live with us,
and act as hostess, since my wife’s health has never permitted
her to undertake the strain of managing the large
literary, artistic and theatrical receptions which we held
weekly for a good many years.</p>

<p class='c016'>During that period Miss Lorimer made an immense circle
of friends, which included practically every one in our
acquaintance. Men like Fisher of the <i>Literary World</i>, and
Robert Barr urged her to write a book for years before she
could persuade herself to put pen to paper, though seeing
so many of my books put together, and transcribing when
they were finished, had familiarised her with the process
of book-making, and though she had assisted me at every
stage, in sight-seeing with an armful of guide-books, in
making copious notes, in studying all the available authorities
on the subject, and in digesting and arranging the information
if it was a travel-book, or in giving her advice about the
story if it was a novel. She must have been with us quite
ten years before she published her first book, <i>A Sweet Disorder</i>.
Since then, besides the two books in which she collaborated
with me, <i>Queer Things about Sicily</i> and <i>More Queer Things
about Japan</i>, she has brought out <i>Josiah’s Wife</i>, <i>Mirry-Ann</i>,
<i>By the Waters of Sicily</i>, <i>Catherine Sterling</i>, <i>On Etna</i>, <i>By the
Waters of Carthage</i>, <i>The Pagan Woman</i>, <i>By the Waters of
Egypt</i>, <i>By the Waters of Italy</i>, <i>The Second Woman</i>, <i>A Wife out
of Egypt</i>, and <i>By the Waters of Germany</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>It gives me great satisfaction to think that she was my
pupil in writing, for most of these books will stand reading
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>again and again for the admirable sayings and analyses of
life with which they are strewn, as well as for their stories,
and the knowledge displayed in them. They are redolent
with the atmosphere of the Isle of Man, Japan, Italy, Sicily,
Tunis and Egypt, and one of them, <i>Josiah’s Wife</i>, contains
a brilliant picture of America, where she lived with us for
nearly three years.</p>

<p class='c016'>Miss Lorimer comes of a very clever family. Her uncle,
James Lorimer, was Professor of International Law in the
Edinburgh University, and wrote some of the standard
books upon the subject. He was a man of international
reputation. His hobby was the restoration of Kellie Castle
in Fifeshire, which he acquired from Lord Kellie and Mar,
and, as the Latin inscription sets forth, “rescued it from the
bats and the owls.” Living at Kellie was the inspiration of
three of his clever children. His youngest son, now Sir
Robert Lorimer, has become the most famous living Scottish
architect. He had the high honour of building the Chapel
of the Knights of the Thistle in St. Giles’ Cathedral, Edinburgh.
His second son, J. H. Lorimer, the Scottish
Academician, is recognised as one of the soundest painters
of the day. One daughter, Lady im Thurn, caught the trick
of the beautiful moulded plaster ceilings at Kellie, done by
a wandering band of Italian artists in the seventeenth
century, and was entrusted with the execution of the moulded
plaster ceilings which Lord Bute had made for his House of
Falkland. Another daughter is an author, and the other
married Sir David Chalmers, the only man who ever earned
two pensions as Chief Justice of two tropical colonies.</p>

<p class='c016'>My next secretary was Miss Maude (Mary) Chester Craven,
who had quarrelled with her stepfather, and was seeking to
make her own way in the world.</p>

<p class='c016'>She was a singularly clever girl, very much interested in
literature, with a great sense of humour, and a great idea
of “copy.” Had she come to me later, when I was writing
the various volumes of <i>Queer Things</i> series, I should have
been able to make better use of her help. She was most
generous and self-sacrificing, and when she had thrown
herself into the subject, you could hardly get her away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>from the papers. And she was very well read on certain
subjects.</p>

<p class='c016'>A few years after she left me she wrote an excellent book
called <i>Famous Beauties of Two Reigns</i>. Since then she has
found a niche all to herself in book-producing—teaching
people who have led interesting lives, and have good stories
to tell, but have had no literary experience, how to put their
biographies together and editing them herself. The books
produced in this way have proved some of the greatest
sensations of our times. Lady Cardigan led off, followed
by the adventurous ex-Crown Princess of Saxony, and Lord
Rossmore’s racy recollections came as an <i>entr’acte</i> to the
drama of Meyerling as narrated by Countess Larisch.</p>

<p class='c016'>Editing these books has made Miss Craven—she is now
Mrs. Charles ffoulkes, wife of the Master of the Armour of
the Tower of London—an admirable raconteur, and she told
me that the late M. Charles Sauerwein, directeur of <i>Le Matin</i>,
had offered her a large sum to write her reminiscences of
her “sitters,” but conscientious scruples prevented her from
accepting the tempting offer, as to disclose all she knew
would have caused trouble in London and elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c016'>The ex-Crown Princess of Saxony, for instance, was a
most ingenuous person, who would have written a chapter,
had Miss Craven permitted her, on “why the royal honeymoon
bored her to tears,” and much more that would have caused
endless scandal and heartburnings to the Saxon court.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Our Louise,” as she was termed by her subjects, had a
positive mania for cleanliness, and she told Miss Craven that
once when she was travelling with her mother the water
supply gave out and she was in despair how to wash her
hands. But necessity originated a brilliant idea, and at
the next stop Louise rushed to the buffet, and returned with
a waiter staggering under many bottles of mineral water,
with which she performed her ablutions. “Surely,” remarked
the Grand Duchess of Tuscany, “there is no
accounting for your vagaries, Louise!”</p>

<p class='c016'>Miss Craven asked the Princess what she most desired to
do when the dullness of palace life obsessed her. “To post
a letter in a pillar-box like any one else,” was the reply.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Once, coming from the Continent, she overheard some fellow-passengers
discussing her rather freely, and entering into the
spirit of the adventure, Louise joined in the conversation,
and for once saw herself as others saw her. “Well,” said
she, as the train slowed into Charing Cross, “you’ve had an
opportunity of meeting that terrible woman—I am the
ex-Crown Princess,” and when the horror-stricken occupants
of the compartment saw her name upon her small luggage,
they realised that the pretty, vivacious, fair woman was none
other than the former wife of the King of Saxony.</p>

<p class='c016'>Lady Cardigan (whose recollections “Labby” described
as a classic) disliked the blue pencil, for she saw no reason
why you should not say what you like in a book. She was
a most brilliant anecdotist, and Miss Craven said she could
tell good stories for a fortnight without repeating herself.
One, which related to a well-known Bacchanalian member
of the aristocracy, is worth recalling. The gentleman in
question once kissed a pretty housemaid, who made a decidedly
original protest. “I wonder, my Lord,” said the girl, “that
a nobleman like you don’t drink champagne. Brandy do
colour your breath.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Lady Cardigan held the opinion that sauce for the goose
was sauce for the gander. “Men fall in love with ballet-girls,
barmaids and servants,” she once remarked, “so why
shouldn’t women fall in love with men of inferior station if
it amuses them?”</p>

<p class='c016'>Maude Craven could tell of flutterings in the dove-cotes of
Mayfair, and of many skeletons in ancestral cupboards whose
bones must have rattled in dread of what Lady Cardigan’s
marvellous memory could have recalled about them.</p>

<p class='c016'>The lady who followed Miss Craven had only been with us
for a short time when the doctors told her that she could
not live in England. She went to California and got married.
Miss Marie Ivory, who followed her, married a famous artist.</p>

<p class='c016'>Miss Ethel Phipps, the next, was with us for several years,
and accompanied us to Italy and Sicily, and inaugurated the
system of tissue-paper scrap-books, which I have found so
useful in collecting the materials for my books of travel.
And she was an excellent typist, the first excellent typist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>we had had, though I took up the use of the typewriter quite
early. The first I ever had was a Remington which I bought
in 1883 in Sydney from a man named Cunningham who
reported law cases for the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i>. He
sold it to me for half the price he had given for it (I paid
him about fifteen pounds, I think), because the judges would
not look at his notes when they were in typewriting. He
had bought the instrument under the idea that the extra
legibility would be received with acclaim. The judges
thought that the machine might not write down what the
reporter meant it to—they credited it with the powers of a
planchette, which was then very fashionable.</p>

<p class='c016'>Miss Phipps wrote a very amusing little book called
<i>Belinda and Others</i>, which Warne bought from her and
published both in England and America.</p>

<p class='c016'>When she left us because she was needed at home, her
place was taken by a very clever and interesting girl fresh
from school, who has made a great name for herself in fiction—Miss
Ethel May Stevens, whose pen-name is Ethel Stefana
Stevens. We took her to Sicily almost directly she came to
us, and Italianised her surname into the nickname Stefana,
by which even her own relations grew to call her.</p>

<p class='c016'>The moment I saw her I was struck by her brilliance and
intelligence, and I did not require to learn that she had
carried everything before her at Miss Douglas’s famous
school in Queen’s Gate, to know that she was much the
ablest of the ladies who answered my advertisement when
Miss Phipps had to leave us.</p>

<p class='c016'>At various times she travelled all over Italy and Sicily
with us, and visited Tunis and Carthage. She was with us
for several years, and a great worker. On her fell the almost
incredible labour of typing out and keeping sorted the
immense mass of materials accumulated chiefly from Italian
sources, for the Encyclopædia called <i>Things Sicilian</i>, which
forms the bulk of my <i>Sicily, the New Winter Resort</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>She had studied a great deal before she came to us, and
besides a good knowledge of French and German and music
(she played the violin charmingly), had a strange accomplishment—she
spoke Romany, the Gipsy language, so fluently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>that when she made up a little, even gipsies took her for a
gipsy. She had learnt it in the New Forest, which was near
her home. She began before she had been very long with
us the gipsy novel, which now, after many years, she has
taken up again. It was a story with a strong love interest
in it, but it gave no promise of the admirable gift of writing
which she has shown in her published works like <i>The Veil</i>
and <i>The Mountain of God</i>. In the large amount of reviewing
which she did for me—against time, it was true—she
had a habit of introducing stock phrases and introductory
periphrases, such as “the worst of the whole matter was
that,” “that redoubtable,” “the venerable form of.”
Her criticisms of books were in judgment very good, but
in expression they were verbose and lacking in distinction.
She was always studying in the fine library which
I had collected as a reviewer. Besides gipsy-lore and
music she was especially interested in everything connected
with occultism and amulets, and the Black Art
generally, and everything connected with the Orient. It
was in the three excellent chapters which she wrote for my
<i>Carthage and Tunis</i>, where they are signed with her own
initials, E. M. S., instead of the E. S. S. she uses now, that
Miss Stevens first showed what she could do when she tried.
The chapters are Chapter VI, Volume I, “The Lavigerie
Museum at Cairo”; Chapter XVIII, Volume II, “Superstition
in Tunis”; Chapter XX, Volume II, “A Tunisian
Harem, and the Tombs of the Beys.”</p>

<p class='c016'>It was when she was visiting Tunis with us that she first
heard the “East a-callin’.” She found it absolutely irresistible.
In the short time that we were there she began to
learn Arabic, and acquired quite a good knowledge of Arab
amulets, and the Egyptian amulets in the museum at Carthage.
She afterwards paid another visit to Tunis before she
wrote her memorable book, <i>The Veil</i>, one of the most successful
novels of its year.</p>

<p class='c016'>In search of a fresh Oriental subject, she next went to
Haifa, the Syrian seaport, where she was lucky enough to
live in the little colony which surrounded the present head
of the Bahai movement, and to see a great deal of the inner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>working of that movement, which is said to count half the
Shia Mohammedans (chiefly Persians) among its secret
adherents. So high an opinion did Abbas Effendi form of
her abilities, that he invited her to stay in his house and
gave her a special course of instruction, which lasted over
many months, in the philosophy of the sect.</p>

<p class='c016'>Her stay at Haifa also supplied her with the materials for
her second novel, <i>The Mountain of God</i>. Since then she has
published several able and successful books, just as <i>The
Earthen Drum</i>, <i>The Long Engagement</i>, <i>The Lure</i> and <i>Sarah
Eden</i>, for the material of which she paid two visits to
Jerusalem.</p>

<p class='c016'>My next secretary, who was with me for seven years, has
also had three books published by leading firms.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is not by any means an uncommon thing for authors’
secretaries to become authors. One of the most conspicuous
examples is Mary E. Wilkins, now Mrs. Freeman-Wilkins,
who was for a long time secretary to Oliver Wendell Holmes.
I well remember the day when he stopped me in the street in
Boston (U.S.A.), to say, “I have a hated rival. My secretary,
Mary Wilkins, has just published a novel—a much better
one than I ever wrote.”</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <br /><span class='c022'>LITERARY CLUBS: MY CONNECTION WITH THE AUTHORS’ CLUB</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>When</span> we came back from the United States in 1891,
besides our wide American circle, most of whom were in the
habit of frequently visiting England in the season, we soon
found ourselves in the heart of a Bohemian society, which
met almost daily at one or other club or reception. Receptions
had become the order of the day among London literary
people, artists and actors. The epidemic came over from
America at the same time as the habit of personal
journalising. Certain popular newspapers devoted columns
and columns every week to giving every species of good-natured
gossip about the biographies and home-lives of well-known
people. It was this movement which culminated
in the production of <i>Who’s Who</i>. Interviewing was a feature
of the day. From living like hermit-crabs, English authors
suddenly began to realise the value of publicity in the sale
of their wares.</p>

<p class='c016'>They had always in a decorous Victorian way met at the
Athenæum Club, but that did not open its doors at all. The
pleasant Garrick and the Savile had an almost equal dread
of literary burglars. The National Club had only a select
few authors who liked its fleshpots. But their younger
rivals saw in receptions a fresh element of interest to attract
and benefit members. The Arts Club, the newly founded
Authors’ Club, the Hogarth, the Savage, the Vagabonds,
and the Playgoers, to all of which I had been elected, were
free and fearless in their hospitalities, and here, and through
friends I met in these clubs, I acquired the friendship of many
of the world’s workers.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Arts Club in those days was a jolly place; charming
and distinguished men could be found dining there almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>every night, and after dinner you played pool with the Royal
Academicians, or talked scandal about the way that artists
were elected, and pictures selected, to the Royal Academy.
These were most enjoyable evenings.</p>

<p class='c016'>At the Hogarth, not far off, the artists who were not in
the Academy or in the Academy set, used to assemble. It
is the artist’s habit to work till daylight is gone, and then to
waste his time in conversation or the billiard-room. The
talk, when it was not shop, was all what they call in theatrical
circles “gag.” Some of their shop was quite interesting,
because it ran upon new men and new methods. I liked
the latter best. Artists, unlike authors, are generally more
ready to detract than to praise. They wish to mount over
the bodies of the slain; they do not hold out a hand to those
who are lower down the hill. But they were very kind to each
other with money, though they were so unkind to each other’s
work, and none of them seemed to stay at home to read after
they had done their work.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Authors’ Club had been established recently enough
for me to come in as an original member. The Vagabonds
Club, which had been in existence for a good many years,
had not yet expanded into the New Vagabonds Club, nor
had the White Friars organised banquets. The old Playgoers
had a good many literary members, chiefly dramatists
or would-be’s. The Arts, the happy hunting-ground of
famous artists, had a few; the Hogarth, the favourite meeting-place
for less favourite artists, had a few more; the Savage,
in spite of its traditions, and the Garrick not many more;
and the editors of the <i>Idler</i> were in the habit of giving teas,
which practically constituted a tea club without a subscription.
I never was at the Yorick.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Authors’ Club at that time took the lead in receptions.
Sir Walter Besant, who founded it, made it his mission in
life to bring authors together, both for the enjoyment of
each other’s company, and for the defence of their common
interests. For these purposes he originated both the Authors’
Club and the Authors’ Society, which had, in 1891, the same
secretary, and himself for chairman of both, but which were
technically unconnected.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>The Authors’ Club owed its success, and especially the
success of its meetings, to Oswald Crawfurd, not less than to
Besant himself. Crawfurd had written a book or two, but
he had no eminence in literature, beyond having put enough
money into Chapman &amp; Hall to become chairman of the
company and editor of its review, the <i>Fortnightly</i>. But
Crawfurd was rich, and at Eton, and as a Consul-General,
he had won the friendship of half the well-known people in
London. He used his influence, his energy and his money,
prodigally, in making the new Club go. He entertained
possible members both at the Club, and in his own home and
at favourite restaurants; he wrote an enormous number
of persuasive letters; he kept the thing going generally.
The Club was his protégé as much as Besant’s.</p>

<p class='c016'>Besant, with whom I had been in correspondence before I
went to America, at the moment that he recruited me for the
Club, was interested in introducing American methods at its
meetings, and as I had just returned from America, the
directors made me honorary secretary for this purpose.</p>

<p class='c016'>I spent three years in America, and during that time enjoyed
the hospitality of all the leading literary and Bohemian
Clubs in New York, Boston and Washington. Washington,
as far as I remember, had only one of any importance, but
Boston and New York were rich in them, and I brought
over ideas from them.</p>

<p class='c016'>I explained to Besant what seemed to me the best features
of American literary gatherings, and he evolved from them a
programme for our weekly dinners at the Authors’ Club; but
he thought that reading a paper, followed by a discussion, or
entertaining a great author, whose health was proposed and
who had to make a reply, was more suited to an English
audience than telling anecdotes. I think he was right;
telling anecdotes is not an English art. The American
expects boundless patience from his audience while he elaborates
the gist of the story; the longer he prolongs the agony,
the better his audience likes it. He has made a fine art
of story-telling, and does it well enough to take the place of a
curtain-raiser at a theatre. The Englishman only does it
in private—generally to the distress of his family—or introduces
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>it incidentally into one of his speeches. Except
barristers, and politicians, and clergymen, most Englishmen
are afraid of the sound of their own voices in public, though
Englishwomen often do not suffer from this disability. There
is really some justification for the story of the man who was
asked to give a definition of <i>woman</i>. He began, “Woman
is, generally speaking....” “Stop there!” said his
friend. “If you went on for a thousand years you would
never get so near it again.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Englishwomen as a class are much better speakers than
Englishmen.</p>

<p class='c016'>We got along comfortably at the Authors’ Club with entertaining
eminent persons, and expecting them to speak in
recognition of the compliment, until Sir Augustus Harris
was asked to propose the health of Isidore di Lara, whose
opera he had just presented at Drury Lane. Harris made a
long speech, in which he told us all that he had done for grand
opera, how much money he had spent, what singers, male and
female he had discovered and the rest of it, and was very
pleased with himself, and after about half-an-hour sat down
without making the slightest allusion to di Lara. Oswald
Crawfurd, I think it was, who noticed the omission, and,
springing to his feet, proposed the toast.</p>

<p class='c016'>After this it was felt that we ought to do something to
strengthen the programme, and Besant proposed a form of
entertainment which had come up in the United States since
I had lived there. A man with the eminent name of Luther
had hit upon an idea for giving authors a fourth profit on
their works, and making them all contributors to his own profit.
He called it “Uncut Leaves.” Under this name he offered
all the most eminent authors in America a generous price
if they would read their productions in a lecture hall before
they were published serially, so that they received money
for recitation as well as for serial rights, book rights and
dramatic rights. I believe it went very well in America for
a while, but in London it was impossible to persuade a Meredith
or a Hardy to listen to such a proposal. To start with, only
a funny man had a chance of getting an English audience
to listen to him reading his own productions.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Later on we did try the anecdotes with some success at
informal dinners.</p>

<p class='c016'>In any case the Authors’ Club dinners and entertainments
became a great success. It was the most popular literary
institution of the day, both at its temporary first home in
Park Place, and afterwards at its proper house in Whitehall
Court. Some of the most eminent men were its guests.
Among them, besides great authors, were great prelates,
great generals, great admirals, great politicians, who enjoyed
being entertained by the Authors’ Club better than at public
banquets, because they only had to speak to fifty or a hundred
men instead of addressing huge assemblies, and the formal
part of the proceedings lasted such a short time that they
might chat afterwards in the smoking-room or the billiard-room
with their hosts, who always had among them men
whose books they had been admiring for years. While
Besant lived he was a great inspiration, and when he died his
place was taken by others who had sprung to the forefront
of literature in the interval.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Authors’ Club differed from the original Vagabonds
Club because only the Speaker or Speakers of the evening
spoke, and the dinner was a more luxurious one. Most
of the literary Vagabonds went to the Authors’ Club too, but
at the Authors’ you met a fair sprinkling of the older authors
like Sir Walter Besant, and, occasionally, Thomas Hardy.
The gatherings were much larger. The Club contained many
more members, and the bringing of guests was much more
usual. Besant and Oswald Crawfurd brought a great many,
generally distinguished men.</p>

<p class='c016'>If the names of everyone present at some of those dinners
were published now, people would be astonished to see what a
high percentage of them have become household words.</p>

<p class='c016'>Among them were John Hay, the greatest man the United
States ever sent us as an Ambassador; the old Lord Chancellor;
the old Lord Chief Justice; Lord Avebury, who
invented the “bank-holidays” known as “St. Lubbock’s-days”;
Lord Strathcona, the father of the Canadian Pacific
Railway, and the synonym for patriotic munificence in these
latter days; Lord Wolseley, then Commander-in-Chief;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>Sir Ian Hamilton, who won the important battles of Wagon
Hill and the Diamond Hills in the South African war; Sir
Edward Seymour, the great Admiral, who won as much
reputation by daring to be a failure on his march from Tientsin
to Peking as he did by all his successes; Admiral Sir
William Kennedy, the wittiest speaker in the navy; Admiral
Sir Hedworth Lambton, now Sir Hedworth Meux; and
Admiral Sir Percy Scott, who saved the situation in the
South African war by converting his 4·7 ship guns into
field guns to meet the Boers’ “long Toms”; Bishop Creighton,
and Bishop Ingram, of London; Bishop Gore, then of Worcester;
Sir Robert Ball, the astronomer; Sir Leslie Stephen,
the father of <i>The Dictionary of National Biography</i>; Sir
Alma Tadema; Sir George Otto Trevelyan, Macaulay’s
nephew, who wrote two of the greatest biographies in the
language, <i>The Life of Macaulay</i> and <i>The Life of Fox</i>, and has
sons who rival him; Sir William Ramsey, F.R.S.; two famous
brothers, the late Rt. Hon. Alfred Lyttleton, the greatest
of all the giants of sport on record except C. B. Fry (who made
the same impression on Parliament as he had made on his
Eton schoolfellows by his loftiness of character), and his
brother Edward, almost equally great in cricket, the head
master of Eton; with authors like Rudyard Kipling, Ian
Maclaren, Doyle, Barrie, Anthony Hope, Augustine Birrell,
and Henry Arthur Jones. There are others equally eminent,
if I could only remember them.</p>

<p class='c016'>The greatest favourite we ever had among our guests at
the Authors’ Club was “Ballahooley”—Robert Jasper
Martin of Cromartin, better known as Bob Martin—a magnificent-looking
Irish squire of the Charles Lever type, who
bubbled over with natural wit.</p>

<p class='c016'>Bob Martin was a brother of Violet Martin of Ross, and
cousin of Edith Œnone Somerville the lady M.F.H., who
collaborated in <i>Some Reminiscences of an Irish R.M</i>. and
other famous books of Irish life and character, and though
he did not write much, he had the same limitless fund of
humour.</p>

<p class='c016'>The first time that ever I took him to the Authors’ Club
the late Lord Wolseley was the guest of the evening, and an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>admirable guest of the evening he was—illustrious, interesting,
urbane, a brilliant talker. He and Martin were old friends,
and after Lord Wolseley’s health had been proposed and he
had responded in a speech which told us all about his literary
work—like Moltke, he was an author by instinct—Martin
got up to tell us some of his inimitable Irish stories. The
first was one about Lord Wolseley himself. In the days
when he was only a colonel, a sergeant-major came to him
for a day’s leave to help his wife in doing the Company’s
washing.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I’ve been speaking to your wife, Pat,” said Colonel
Wolseley, “and she begged me, whenever you came to me
for leave on her washing-day, to refuse you because you get
in her way so.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The man saluted, and turned to leave the room, but when he
got to the door he turned round and saluted again, and asked,
“Have I your leave to say something, Colonel?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yes, Pat.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, what I wish to say, sir, is that one of us two must
be handling the truth rather carelessly, because I haven’t
got a wife.”</p>

<p class='c016'>True or untrue, Lord Wolseley did not deny the impeachment.</p>

<p class='c016'>That same night “Ballahooley” told us of his first experience
of the Castle at Dublin. He was asked to stay there
the first time he ever came to town, and he was not used to
town ways. When his jaunting-car pulled up at the door of
the Castle, he told the footman to give the coachman a drink,
which was the custom of the country at Cromartin. The
footman stared at him.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Didn’t you hear what I said?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yes, sir, I heard,” said the footman slowly, and disappeared
to fetch the drink because Martin swore at him so.
When he came back, he brought a liqueur-glass of Benedictine
on an immense silver tray. The coachman took the glass
and smelt it—doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It’s all right, Pat, it was made by the Holy Fathers.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Thus encouraged, Pat drank it off. He made a wry
face.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>“Don’t you like it, Pat? It’s very good.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Oh, it’s good enough,” said the Jehu, “but what I’m
thinking is that the man who blew that glass was mighty short
of breath.”</p>

<p class='c016'>That same evening he told us of the first election to a
District Council which was ever held on his estates. The
place was a hotbed of Nationalism, and Bob Martin was very
anxious to have a friend of his, who was a Conservative,
elected on to the Council. So he assembled all his tenants,
and said to them, “I wish you’d elect this man. I’ve never
asked you to do anything for me before, and I’ve made more
money out of one rotten song (‘Ballahooley’) than out of
the whole blessed lot of you ever since I came in for this
place.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Their Irish minds were so struck by this piece of special
pleading that they returned his candidate unopposed.</p>

<p class='c016'>Bishop Creighton was a very entertaining guest. Just
because he was so great and so potent as an administrator,
he could be perfectly natural when he was dining with a couple
of score of authors. One could not imagine the present Bishop—whom
I remember in the days when he was at Keble—he
was a very plucky player at football, which he had learned
at Marlborough—blurting out like his predecessor that the
first thing he asked about a parson who was recommended
for a living in his gift was “Is he a hustler?” Nor can one
imagine him fencing with the late Father Stanton of St.
Alban’s, Holborn, over the use of incense.</p>

<p class='c016'>I wish I had not forgotten the name of that club to which
he and Balfour and I forget what others of the greatest in
the land, a dozen or twenty in all, mostly great politicians
or prelates, belonged, who dined together at the Grand
Hotel once or twice a month, and quietly enjoyed themselves
like the <i>Dilettanti</i>. I suppose that it exists still.</p>

<p class='c016'>Bishop Gore was delightfully human the night that we
entertained him at the Authors’ Club. He said that he felt
quite shy of replying to the toast of his health—that generally,
when he was speaking, he was addressing an audience upon
subjects on which he was entitled to speak with authority,
and upon which his audience were very anxious to hear what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>he had to say, but that on this occasion he was going to talk
about a subject which interested no one, meaning himself,
and he was quite at a loss what to say.</p>

<p class='c016'>Sir Evelyn Wood, one of the few men who have ever won
the V.C. both as a sailor and a soldier—he was a midshipman
before he was a soldier, and made a famous ride with dispatches—and
he has been called to the Bar since—supplemented
his speech in reply to the toast with a selection of rattling
anecdotes.</p>

<p class='c016'>Sir Ian Hamilton, the General who saved Ladysmith by
his victory at Wagon Hill, described the touch and go of
his battle, which saved Ladysmith, in the slang of ordinary
conversation, which made it extraordinarily impressive. It
was very appropriate, too, for slang was the language of the
brief council of war which Sir Ian held with the Colonel of
the Devons before they launched the charge which saved the
day.</p>

<p class='c016'>One of the most interesting dinners we ever had was the
dinner we gave to Zola in the Whitehall Rooms. We had
other guests, varying from Stepniak, the Nihilist, to Frank
Stockton and Bill Nye, the American humorists. Stockton
told one of his characteristic American after-dinner stories
of the “lady or the tiger” sort. Nye was really wonderful.
He said that he himself belonged to an old French family—that
the Nye family used always to spell their name Ney,
but they changed it because one of the family was unfortunate.
This allusion to the bravest of the brave brought the house
down, but it took about a quarter of an hour to explain it
to Zola.</p>

<p class='c016'>Henry Arthur Jones was extraordinarily interesting—Jones,
if you catch him in the right mood, can make a really
fine speech, full of imagination.</p>

<p class='c016'>One man whom I first met at the Authors’ Club, and whom
I afterwards got to know better, though I have not seen him
for many years—Lucien Wolf, had an extremely original way
of working. Besides his ordinary press work, once a month he
contributed a presentation of the foreign politics of the world
to one of the principal Reviews. As foreign editor of a daily
paper, he had the subject at his fingers’ ends, but it troubled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>him in a subject so full of tangled threads to break off his
work for meals and to go to bed. Writing that article took
about forty-eight hours, and during that time he hardly left
his study; he did not go to bed at all; like the Admiral who
gave them their name, he had sandwiches brought to him
where he sat. He apparently felt no ill-effects from this
tremendous effort of will-power and industry, though, of
course, he looked very tired. His articles on foreign affairs
in the monthly Reviews took the premier place.</p>

<p class='c016'>Poulteney Bigelow was a character at the Authors’ Club
in those days. The son of an American Ambassador—minister,
as they were then called—he was, for some reason
or another, an intimate personal friend of the German Emperor,
with whom he constantly stayed, and of whom he treasured
many anecdotes. He once nearly persuaded the Emperor to
dine at the Authors’ Club. He disappeared for a while, and
went out West in the United States again, from which he
came back very full of the shooting exploits of Theodore
Roosevelt, another of his friends.</p>

<p class='c016'>Bigelow always maintained that the Spanish-American
war was the best thing which ever happened for the relations
between Great Britain and the United States. He said that
the garrison, who died like flies in the Philippines, were mostly
drawn from the South-Western States, where the hatred
of England had been liveliest, and their colonial experiences
made them understand how considerate the English were to
subject peoples, and how very inconsiderate subject peoples
were apt to be to their rulers.</p>

<p class='c016'>We had quite a bevy of leading editors among our members,
some of whom put in an appearance pretty constantly, but
it never was a very active editor’s club; I think they were
too afraid of would-be contributors.</p>

<p class='c016'>William Sinclair, the Archdeacon of London, who was the
principal figure at London functions for nearly a generation,
was a pillar of the Club. He was a constant attendant at
its house dinners, and apart from his influence and position,
was a brilliant raconteur. Sometimes, like a true Scotsman,
he told a story against himself, as when he told us why he was
such a popular preacher at the Guards’ chapel—because the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>men said that he was the only person who ever preached to
them with a voice like a sergeant-major.</p>

<p class='c016'>Sinclair had met everybody of any importance in his time.
He had one beautiful story of a Scotsman who suddenly became
a Cabinet Minister on four or five thousand a year, and sported
a butler. Sinclair, who was staying with him, in all innocence
asked what the man’s name was, and his hostess said,
“I don’t know; we always call him waiter.”</p>

<p class='c016'>After Besant’s death, the two men who were most prominent
at the Authors’ Club were certainly Conan Doyle and Anthony
Hope—Doyle especially, because he was for a long time chairman
of the Club, and a frequent attendant at the dinners.
I wish I could remember only a tithe of the interesting and
amusing things he said at that dinner-table, for Doyle always
says something memorable in his speeches. But once I was
so interested that I kept a note of what he said written down
on my menu card. It was about his famous pamphlet—<i>The
War; its Causes and its Conduct</i>. He told his audience
that it came to him in an instant, like all great things in
life, which hit on the head like a bullet. He was reading
some peculiarly diabolical misrepresentations by the German
editors. “Yet these men,” he told himself, “were, in the
ordinary affairs of life, honest men. Many books have been
written from our standpoint; but, in the first place, a German
editor cannot buy a book which costs six shillings or more,
and in the second place, he has not got time to read through
it. The only thing is to give him free of cost something
which he can read in an hour. My materials were all to
hand. I know how humane Tommy Atkins was to his
enemies, and I had been flooded with letters on the subject
in reply to an advertisement I had inserted in the newspapers.
Half-a-dozen things which have occurred to me in my life
must have been foreordained.</p>

<p class='c016'>“At a small dinner that night I sat next to ——. I
explained my project to him. ‘How will you get the money?’
he asked. ‘From the public.’ ‘Well, I’ll get a thousand
pounds for you.’</p>

<p class='c016'>“Chance had thrown me against the man who knew everything
I wanted to know. He could even tell me the names of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>the people who could translate it into the various languages.
Five months later I had the book on my table in twenty
languages. Rich men gave their fifty pounds to the scheme,
poor people scraped together their half-crowns to do their
widow’s-mites’ worth for England. I sent that pamphlet
to every man in Europe whose opinion counted. Leyds gave
me the cue. It is astonishing how few people govern the
public opinion of the world. In two countries an honest
second edition was called for—Hungary and Portugal. In
the latter, our old ally, there was a most kindly feeling for
us, a genuine anxiety to learn the true facts of the case.
In Germany the whole twenty thousand copies were distributed;
twelve thousand of them gratis, and eight sold. The
Swiss actually printed an edition for themselves.”</p>

<p class='c016'>He told us this on the night that we entertained him and
Gilbert Parker in honour of their knighthood, and he told
us how that morning a letter of congratulation from his
gunsmith had arrived, addressed to “Sir Sherlock Holmes.”
The best thing he ever told us about <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> was
its fate when he made a play of it, and sold it to a famous
actor. The actor stipulated that he should be allowed to
alter it as much as he liked, and when Doyle went to the
rehearsals, he found that there was practically nothing of
his play left except the title. That was all the actor really
wanted to buy; he had made his own play out of the Sherlock
Holmes stories before he went to Doyle.</p>

<p class='c016'>It was at an Authors’ Club dinner that Hall Caine made
his awful disclosure about Londoners’ insides. He said that
no family could live in London for more than three generations
unless its members went away for a change of air, and that
the smoke-charged state of the atmosphere turned their insides
from a healthy red to a slaty black. It was that same night
that he recited his poem “Ellan Vannin” to us.</p>

<p class='c016'>I remember, in the early days of the Authors’ Club, J. M.
Barrie telling the Club a story in the American story-teller’s
fashion. I don’t suppose for an instant that it had actually
happened. I expect it was just a <i>ben trovato</i>, but it was none
the less amusing. He apologised for being late. He had been
to the wrong club. He had never been to the Authors’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>Club before, he said (though he was a member of the committee),
so he asked a policeman the way. From the way
in which he pronounced the word, the policeman thought
he meant Arthur’s, which was quite near the Authors’ Club
when it was in its temporary premises in Park Place. When
he got there he found it a very grand place, he said. The
club porter looked him up and down, and said “The servants’
entrance is round the corner.”</p>

<p class='c016'>It took the moral courage of a Scotsman to tell that story—true
or untrue. It was inimitably funny, told in the broad
Doric of <i>The Little Minister</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>Jerome actually had an experience of this sort in New York.
But it was not due to the obtuseness of the club porter.
He received a straight-out invitation from the servants of
one of the great New York clubs to spend the evening with
them. I suppose they have their story-tellers’ nights like
the members. He said that he never enjoyed himself more
in his life.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c011'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c023' id='f3'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Authors’ Club, before it was reconstructed, contained a number of very
representative members. Among them were Sir Walter Besant, Conan Doyle,
Frankfort Moore, Hall Caine, Lindsay Bashford, R. D. Blumenfeld, F. T.
Bullen, W. L. Courtney, S. R. Crockett, Sir Michael Foster, secretary of the
Royal Society, J. Foster Fraser, Sydney Grundy, Charles Garvice, F. H.
Gribble, H. A. Gwynne, the editor of the <i>Morning Post</i>, Major Arthur Griffiths,
Rider Haggard, Cutcliffe Hyne, Anthony Hope, Clive Holland, Joseph
Hocking, E. W. Hornung, Sir Henry Irving, J. K. Jerome, Henry Arthur
Jones, Edward Jenks, who wrote that famous book <i>Ginx’s Baby</i>, and was
once M.P. for Hull, Rudyard Kipling, Otto Kyllman, Archdeacon Sinclair,
Norman McColl, editor of the <i>Athenæum</i>, Prof. Meiklejohn, father of the V.C.
who was killed in putting a horse that could not jump at some railings in the
Park to avoid running over a child; A. W. Marchmont, Bertram Mitford,
J. Eveleigh Nash, Gilbert Parker, Barry Pain, J. M. Barrie, Max Pemberton,
Sir J. Rennell Rodd, British Ambassador at Rome, Morley Roberts, Algernon

Horace Wyndham, and others.</p>
</div>

<p class='c016'>But the Club could never rise much above three hundred
members. Many a time have G. Herbert Thring, the
secretary, and I discussed with our board, consisting from
time to time of Besant, Oswald Crawfurd, Lord Monkswell,
Tedder, the literary executor of Herbert Spencer, Conan Doyle,
Anthony Hope, Hall Caine, Frankfort Moore, Morley Roberts,
and Percy White, projects for bringing in more members.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>The change from the temporary premises in Park Place
behind St. James’ Street, to the pleasant rooms overlooking
the river, did something for us. But we were faced by a
dilemma, which was that we had to widen the basis of our
membership to get enough members to pay the huge rent of
the premises, which we had taken for a term of years. If,
instead of having these premises, we had hired a reading-room,
and a smoking-room, and a dining-room in a hotel, we could
have got the accommodation for a hundred a year, and as
only a tithe of the Club ever used it, except on the nights
when they were brought together by notice for the Club
dinners, any premises would have been large enough; the hotel
would always have lent us a room of any size which we could
fill for a dinner. The Whitefriars principle would have suited
us admirably, and the Hotel Cecil would have made a good
venue. But we had these premises on our hands, and we
wanted a larger membership, not to fill them, but to make
financial arrangements easier. I myself in my time enlisted
no fewer than a hundred members for the Club. But that did
not fill up the wastage.</p>

<p class='c016'>Thring saw the need of widening our basis as clearly as
I did, but we never could carry our board with us to make an
enlargement of the franchise sufficiently drastic, because they
wished to be guided by the feeling of the men who used the
Club most, and their feeling was decidedly against it—mainly,
I believe, because they thought that the extra members we
wanted to relieve the finances would make the Club too full
to be restful. So in one way and another the old Club was
drifting on to the rocks when Algernon Rose (with Charles
Garvice as his chairman, and Cato Worsfold as honorary
solicitor) took the matter in hand as honorary secretary.
I did not see the throes. I was out of England on one of
my wander-years.</p>

<p class='c016'>Rose, with a clear-sighted policy, boundless energy and
self-sacrifice, and inexhaustible tact, not only pulled the Club
out of the fire, but has made it one of the most flourishing
organisations in London, with two hundred town members,
three hundred suburban members, five hundred country
members, and six hundred oversea members. He could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>easily have a thousand town members if he wanted them,
but the town membership is strictly limited to two hundred,
and the suburban to three hundred, because that is the limit
of habitués which the premises can accommodate. Unfortunately
you can’t have five-day members at an Authors’
Club like you do at a Golf Club.</p>

<p class='c016'>And nowadays members use the Club in a way they never
did when I was the honorary secretary and we exhausted our
ingenuity in efforts to make the club more inhabited through
the week. The increase of attendance at the Monday night
dinners is one of the most wonderful things of all. Week
after week they have enormous dinners, and Rose provides
a brilliant succession of famous guests of the evening. The
other Tuesday I read a report of an Authors’ Club dinner in
the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> which filled three columns.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c011'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c023' id='f4'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Among the guests of the evening at the Authors’ Club since Rose took it
over have been musicians like Sir Charles Villiers Stanford, Sir Walter Parratt,
Sir Frederick Cowen, Mr. William H. Cummings, Sir Hubert Parry; supreme
scientists like Sir George Darwin, F.R.S., Sir Oliver Lodge, F.R.S., Sir
William Ramsay, F.R.S., Sir William Crookes, F.R.S., Prof. Schäfer, F.R.S.;
great lawyers, like Lord Chancellor Halsbury, the late Lord Chief Justice,
and Lord Justice Fletcher Moulton; men who have been great outside the
Empire like Sir Robert Hart, and Dr. G. E. Morrison of Peking, and Mr. F. C.
Selous, the mighty hunter; great politicians, like Lord Milner, and Lord
Wemyss; great explorers, like Sir Ernest Shackleton; great artists, like the late
Sir Hubert von Herkomer; distinguished foreigners, like the American Ambassadors,
Whitelaw-Reid and Page; well-known literary men, like Harold Cox,
secretary of the Cobden Society, Maarten Maartens, Sir Owen Seaman, Sir
Sidney Lee, W. B. Maxwell; and great actors, like Sir Herbert Beerbohm-Tree.</p>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The Club retains practically all its old outstanding names,
including that of Thring. Thring for many years was the
Authors’ Club personified. He not only conducted its business;
he peopled the club. Men went to lunch there because
they knew they would meet Thring. They dropped in after
business hours because they knew that Thring, at any rate,
would be there. He kept the social life of the Club, as typified
in the Club pools, and so on, going, and he was the friend of
all the members, except those who desired to remain unsociable.
And, in consequence, he always had his finger on
the pulse of the Club.</p>

<p class='c016'>The questions of club discipline which came up before the
board in its early days were some of them of the most extraordinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>nature. One man hated hearing clocks tick, and
whenever he was left alone in a room always stopped the
clock. Somebody else wished to have him turned out of
the Club, but the Chairman said he did not see how it could
be regarded as ungentlemanly behaviour, and proposed that
no action should be taken, but that we should take it in
turns never to leave the honourable member alone!</p>

<p class='c016'>The Rev. John Watson, who, under the pen-name of
“Ian Maclaren,” suddenly burst into fame with <i>Beside the
Bonnie Brier Bush</i> when he was forty-four years old, was a
Liverpool clergyman, the minister of the Sefton Park Presbyterian
Church. He had long enjoyed a reputation in his
circle in Liverpool for story-telling and as a public speaker.
His speeches were as good as his stories, and admirably
delivered. His personal charm was as great as the respect
in which he was held. He was very humorous. He told us
one night, when he was our guest at the Authors’ Club, that
his boy at Rugby had said to him, “Father, I suppose that
your books are all right to some people, or you would not
be able to do so much for us. But couldn’t you write something
which would be good enough for me to show the other
chaps?”</p>

<p class='c016'>One wonders if this was the boy who is now the head of
Nisbet’s great publishing house. If it was, how pleased he
would be to have the publication of some of the books that
were not good enough “to show the other chaps!”</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <br /><span class='c022'>LITERARY CLUBS: THE IDLERS AND THE VAGABONDS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>At</span> the beginning the Authors’ Club had no exact rivals,
but there were two institutions, very much intertwined, which
came near it in a way—the Vagabonds Club and the Idler
teas. The Vagabonds Club, in its conception, had been a little
coterie of authors who met in the rooms of their friend, the
blind poet, Philip Bourke Marston; but before I came back
from America Marston was dead, and the coterie had been
turned into a small dining club, which used to take eighteen-penny
dinners at cheap restaurants, and in theory drank beer
and smoked clay pipes. The committee included Jerome, C. N.
Williamson and F. W. Robinson, and the Club had among
its members, besides those just mentioned, Conan Doyle,
Israel Zangwill, Anthony Hope, Bernard Partridge, Dudley
Hardy, Phil May, Hal Hurst, Rudolph Blind, Pett Ridge,
Joe Hatton, Robert Barr, Coulson Kernahan, W. L. Alden,
Hall Caine, Sir Alfred East, E. W. Hornung, Sir Gilbert
Parker, J. M. Barrie, Barry Pain, Arthur Morrison, Solomon
J. Solomon, and, of course, George Burgin, the original and
indefatigable secretary.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of these people Jerome and Barr were editors of the <i>Idler</i>,
Burgin was sub-editor, Doyle, Zangwill, Pett Ridge and
Anthony Hope were its favourite contributors. The <i>Idler</i>,
in those days published by Chatto &amp; Windus, was edited
in a flat in Arundel Street, Strand, and there every week, on
Wednesday afternoons, as far as I remember, the editors
gave a tea at which they welcomed their contributors, and
any friends whom contributors chose to bring with them, and
the friends of these friends thereafter. It was like the snow-ball
system of selling umbrellas in the United States.</p>

<p class='c016'>The teas were of the simplest. I do not think we had anything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>except bread and butter and tea, but nobody wanted
more; it was sufficient that here was the common meeting-ground
for men and women, where you might, and often did,
meet the ablest young authors of the day. I should say that
the Idler teas were the first literary gatherings in London
attended by Weyman and Crockett, and they certainly were
the first attended by Anthony Hope, W. W. Jacobs and
Frankfort Moore.</p>

<p class='c016'>We received the warmest welcome at the Idlers, because
there were many literary Americans in London just then,
and both Jerome and Barr were insistent that I should bring
as many as possible of them to their teas.</p>

<p class='c016'>At those teas the principal occupation was introducing
every freshcomer to as many people as possible, as the hosts
do at American at-homes; and Jerome made a good many of
his arrangements for articles and illustrations with the people
who came to the teas. It was characteristic of the Idler and
Vagabond gatherings to talk shop and do business without
any pretence of concealment.</p>

<p class='c016'>Hal Hurst and Dudley Hardy were two of Jerome’s
favourite illustrators. Other artists who were there a great
deal were Robert Sauber, John Gülich, Lewis Baumer, Fred
Pegram, James Greig, Paxton, A. S. Hartrick, Louis Wain,
who almost always drew cats with human expressions, a
little man named Martin Anderson, who called himself
“Cynicus,” and had an allegorical vein of humour. He won
himself undying popularity here by bringing to one of those
teas a charmingly pretty young American, who was soon to
feel her footing as a writer. She had not yet written <i>The
Barn-stormers</i>. This was Alice Livingston, who is now
known to all the world as Mrs. C. N. Williamson. Townsend,
the present art-editor of <i>Punch</i>; Chris and Gertrude Hammond,
who were among the most charming book-illustrators of that
day; Seppings Wright, the naval war correspondent; Holland
Tringham, Melton Prior, Fred Villiers and many other
artists came constantly.</p>

<p class='c016'>The great advantage of those Idler teas was that women
as well as men could be present, and in those days women
were not considered worthy to be admitted to authors’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>banquets, except at the annual function of the Authors’
Society. Of course, you had the chance of meeting women
authors at the at-homes of the Pioneer, Writers’, and Grosvenor
Crescent Clubs, because they were all ladies’ institutions.
But at their entertainments you met only a very
few men of any importance, and not particularly many
women of literary importance, other than journalistic. They
were more interested in women’s movements—the Pioneer
might almost be called the ancestor of the Suffragettes.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c011'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c023' id='f5'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r5'>5</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Among the eminent women whom I remember seeing at the Idlers were
Marie Corelli, Mona Caird, Mrs. Sidgwick (Mrs. Andrew Dean), Mrs. Campbell
Praed, Mrs. Humphry Ward, Mrs. Lynn Linton, Mrs. Alexander, Mrs. Meynell,
Miss Montrésor, Lucas Malet and Ellen Thorneycroft Fowler.</p>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The conversations at the Idler teas were very shoppy. I
remember being introduced to Ellen Fowler as the woman
whose witty sayings had long been the delight of the exalted
circles in which she moved, and who had been induced by the
various leading authors whom she knew to write a book.
This is the sort of laudation which we professional authors
often hear and usually distrust. But the book happened to
be <i>Concerning Isabel Carnaby</i>, and when I learned that the
circle which she had dazzled was the circle in which the
Liberal leaders moved, since she was the daughter of Sir
Henry Fowler, M.P., afterwards Lord Wolverhampton, I
understood that she certainly would have received an encouragement
to write books from the authors and critics who
were admitted to Front Bench Liberal dinners.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mona Caird, whom we met often at the Women’s Clubs
afterwards, did much for the emancipation of women in
those days, for she was not only clear-sighted and convincing
in what she said and wrote, but she had a winning personality
which commanded the sympathies of those who were not
predisposed to share her views.</p>

<p class='c016'>It was at an Idler tea that I first met George Bennett
Burgin, with whom I was to be so intimately connected for
so many years as joint Hon. Secretary of the New Vagabonds
Club. He was the sub-editor of the famous <i>Idler Magazine</i>,
and his tact and geniality were constantly in requisition, for
the pugnacity of his chiefs was proverbial, and some of the
best contributors were equally pugnacious.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>I forget if it was a recognised part of the proceedings at
the Old Vagabond dinners to have a set subject for discussion.
Some one always did get up and make a short speech, and in
a club which had men like Jerome and Zangwill and Barry
Pain to draw on, the speaking was always witty, unless the
subject forbade it. The chief difference was that people did
not discuss the speech by getting on their legs to fire witticisms
at the speaker. They discussed it where they sat, sometimes
talking to each other about it (or anything else), sometimes
raising their voices to question the man who had been speaking,
or to argue with him.</p>

<p class='c016'>There was much less discussion of the subject than there
was talking of shop. The point of the gatherings was that
a number of brilliant young authors and artists dined together
fraternally once a month.</p>

<p class='c016'>It was a great boon to me suddenly to be received into the
intimacy of some of the busiest and best-known authors and
editors and black-and-white artists of the day, to hear and
take part in their “shop.”<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c011'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c023' id='f6'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r6'>6</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This Idler and Vagabond set included, besides those mentioned above,
Anthony Hope, Frankfort Moore, Israel Zangwill, Eden Phillpotts, C. N.
Williamson, F. W. Robinson, Joseph Hatton, Coulson Kernahan, George
Manville Fenn, G. A. Henty, W. Pett Ridge, H. G. Wells, Frederic Villiers,
Henry Arthur Jones, Francis Gribble, Rudyard Kipling, Arthur A. Beckett,
William Watson, John Davidson, H. Breakstad the Norwegian, and Carl
Hentschel, the founder of the old Playgoers Club.</p>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Burgin, the hon. secretary of the Old Vagabonds Club, who
was once private secretary to Sir Samuel Baker in Constantinople
and Asia Minor, and has been a great traveller in recent
years, was sub-editor of the <i>Idler Magazine</i> until 1899.
Since then he has given himself up to novel-writing, gardening
and the control of literary clubs. One of his novels, <i>Shutters
of Silence</i>, has been through thirty editions. His books
are distinguished alike by uncommon vivacity and by exceptional
skill in using local colour. They are very good indeed,
and if they had their rights would be among the most popular
books of the day.</p>

<p class='c016'>I have made several attempts to discover when the original
Vagabonds Club was actually started, and the best account
I have had of it was from Kernahan, one of the oldest members.
I certainly did not join it till about five years later.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>He writes—</p>

<p class='c016'>“Marston died February 14, 1887, Valentine’s Day. Yes,
I was one of those who visited his rooms, 191 Euston Road.
When he founded the Club I do not exactly know. I
fancy it had only just been started when, at his invitation, I
joined in 1886. We dined at Pagani’s and then adjourned
to his rooms, keeping it up very late. After he died the
Club practically ceased, as it was he who ran it. Then I
think Herbert Clark proposed that we should continue meeting
and call ourselves the Marston Club—not a good name, as I
always held, for it gave the idea that it was like the Browning
club or society, for the study of his poems, whereas it was
merely a gathering of Marston’s old friends. All the same,
lots of interesting men came to it. His father, Dr. Westland
Marston, for one. So things went on for a long time, and the
thing was dropping to pieces for want of some one to work it,
until you came along, put us in the shop window, and, lo and
behold, the old Club became a new force.”</p>

<p class='c016'>It was not so very long after I joined the Club that it fell
on evil days, not, I hope, because I joined it, but because
it contained Socialists, who are apt to wreck things. The
course they took was most revolutionary. There were two
of them on the committee, and they insisted on having
committee meetings, which insisted on having a voice in the
management of the Club.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Club would not stand it; it transformed itself into a
New Vagabonds Club without the offending members. I
took a leading part in the transformation. I became associated
with Burgin in the honorary secretaryship because
I persuaded a hundred well-known men, like Crockett and
Weyman and Reginald Cleaver, to join the Club, and we
retained the old committee, minus the impossibles, and
strengthened by the inclusion of Frankfort Moore and Joe
Hatton. And this was a well-behaved committee, because
I do not think it met once during its whole existence of not
far short of twenty years. Burgin and I were the honorary
secretaries and managers, and we used to decide everything,
without even thinking of the committee, who, as reformed,
had only one idea in their heads, which was that they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>not to be bothered unless there was some real necessity
for it.</p>

<p class='c016'>Our most successful dinner, at which about six hundred
people were present, was held in honour of Field-Marshal
Lord Roberts—the idol of the nation. Lord Roberts has a
wonderful memory, not only for faces, but for the records
which go with the faces. When I met him the other night
at the Authors’ Society dinner, of which likewise he was
the guest, he took me by the arm, and whispered, “Isn’t
<i>Who’s Who</i> getting very fat?” which was his way of showing
that he remembered that I was the author of <i>Who’s Who</i>
in its present form—or, rather, in the form which it bore from
1897 to 1899, when its figure was not so middle-aged.</p>

<p class='c016'>That Vagabond dinner to Lord Roberts was in honour of
the publication of his celebrated <i>Forty-One Years in India</i>,
and the Authors’ Society dinner to him was also in its honour,
though so many years later.</p>

<p class='c016'>Jerome took the chair to Lord Roberts at the Vagabonds.
He was very interested in <i>Forty-One Years in India</i>. He
had commissioned me to write the long review of it in the
<i>Idler</i>, and I am sure that he and the Field-Marshal, V.C.,
though looking at everything from an exactly opposite
standpoint, got on like a house on fire.</p>

<p class='c016'>The dinner to Lord Roberts was the very largest we ever
had, though the lunches to Sarah Bernhardt and to Sir
Henry Irving were about as numerously attended. Irving
made himself perfectly charming, but when he came to reply
to the toast to his health, the audience were confronted by
the curious phenomenon that the first actor in Europe was
totally unable to make himself heard even half-way across
the hall, and if they could have heard what he said, they
would have been confronted by the equally curious fact that
he was no speaker. That, however, is nothing—very few
actors can speak, always excepting my friend, Tree, who, if
he is in the mood, brings the house down time after time with
his naïveté.</p>

<p class='c016'>There were few eighteen-carat dramatic celebrities whom
we did not entertain at the Vagabonds—Irving and Sarah
Bernhardt, Wyndham and Mary Moore, the Trees and Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Patrick Campbell, the Bourchiers and the Maudes, the young
Irvings, and Lena Ashwell, occur to me first.</p>

<p class='c016'>Sarah Bernhardt’s appearance was a very memorable one.
Mr. Balfour was in the chair. He was Prime Minister at
the time, and had important business at the House of Commons
that afternoon. Sarah was three-quarters of an hour
late. I, who had charge of the guests, while Burgin was
making sure that all his orders for a banquet of five hundred
people had been carried out, felt more nervous than I had
ever felt in my life at the slight which was being offered to
so great a man. I racked my brain for adequate apologies,
but Mr. Balfour said, with his perfect manners, “Please don’t
worry yourself about that, Mr. Sladen. Tell me about
Japan.”</p>

<p class='c016'>If Sarah was as great as he was in other respects, she
certainly was not as great in this respect, for a day or two
afterwards, T. P. O’Connor asked Sarah and Mortimer Menpes,
and Norma Lorimer and myself, to have tea with some
M.P.s on the terrace of the House of Commons. We duly
arrived—even Sarah was fairly punctual—and were herded
in the lobby of the House, like people waiting to see the
editor in a newspaper office, while a search was made for
T. P. O’Connor. He could not be found anywhere, and a
long time passed. I do not know how long it was, but it
seemed years, because Sarah was so angry. She had expected
to be met at the door with due ceremony—perhaps the leaders
of both parties, the Lord Chancellor, and the Speaker—but
nobody met her at all, and none of us could speak French
well enough to understand the unmeasured language she was
using about O’Connor. Finally, she lost her temper altogether,
and though she had told me on several occasions that
she could not speak English, she was quite equal to telling
us in our own language what she thought of T. P. Finally,
some wholly unsuitable member of the Irish party—Dillon,
or somebody just as gloomy—came, waving a telegram.
O’Connor, it appeared, had been caught in a railway accident
coming back from the Henley Regatta, miles from a telegraph
office. As soon as he got to a place where he could telegraph
from, he did telegraph, but Sarah was not appeased, even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>though Menpes offered to go to her island off the coast of
Brittany and arrange a Japanese room for her.</p>

<p class='c016'>I remember a similar contretemps, almost equally amusing,
when George Cawston, one of the directors of the Chartered
Company, gave a great supper at Willis’s rooms in honour
of a South African millionaire. He invited a number of
eminent people to meet him—politicians, soldiers, authors,
actors, artists and public people generally, most of whom
knew each other. The millionaire, who was very “swollen-headed,”
was shamelessly late. So, finally, Cawston decided
to begin without him. The people made up parties, and
sat down at the various little tables, and enjoyed the munificent
supper, and finally went away not knowing or caring
whether the millionaire had been there or not. They had
most of them never heard of him.</p>

<p class='c016'>Sarah came to us a year later to a huge afternoon reception,
which we got up in her honour, and she honoured us by
giving us a long and magnificent recitation from <i>L’Aiglon</i>
(which she had just produced), in which she was supported
by her leading man.</p>

<p class='c016'>We entertained other famous soldiers besides Lord Roberts,
such as Lord Dundonald, when he came back from the great
exploit of his life, the relief of Ladysmith, and Sir Ian Hamilton.
Cecil Raleigh, I remember, took the chair to Sir Ian Hamilton,
and showed his versatility by making a really admirable
speech. I do not remember who it was who took the chair
to Lord Dundonald, but he told a characteristic story of Lord
Dundonald in his earlier service in Egypt.</p>

<p class='c016'>When the news of the fall of Khartum reached the army
which might have relieved Khartum, if Sir Charles Wilson had
pushed on, taking the risks as Lord Roberts would have taken
them, after the victory of Abu Klea, the General asked for an
officer to volunteer to carry the dispatches to Sir Redvers
Buller at the base. It was necessary to have some one with
a knowledge of astronomy, because he had to find his way
across the desert, to avoid the great loop of the Nile above
the Second Cataract. There were many men who would have
risked the dangers of meeting wandering parties of dervishes,
but there was only one of the force who was not only prepared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>to take the risk, but possessed the requisite astronomical
knowledge, and that was Lord Cochrane, a subaltern in the
2nd Life Guards, the future Lord Dundonald. He carried
out his mission, and in an incredibly small number of hours
presented the dispatches to Sir Redvers, whom he found sleeping
under a palm tree. As soon as he had delivered them,
he collapsed with exhaustion.</p>

<p class='c016'>He is a grandson, of course, of the immortal frigate Commander,
the fighting Lord Cochrane, the Almirante Cochrane
who was the liberator of South America, and is a distinguished
inventor. He invented the pocket heating apparatus for
soldiers to carry when doing sentry work in cold climates,
the extra light carriages used for machine-guns in the Boer
War, and the apparatus for enabling cavalry soldiers to turn
out ready for duty as quickly as firemen.</p>

<p class='c016'>From time to time we entertained distinguished ecclesiastics
such as the late and the present Bishops of London and the
ex-Bishop of Ripon. Creighton was much the best guest of
the three, for he had a most saving gift of humour.</p>

<p class='c016'>For some reason or other, on the night that he was with us,
at the conclusion of his speech returning thanks for the
way in which his health has been proposed, he had to propose
the toast of journalism, coupled with the name of the editor
of <i>The Times</i>. He said, “I do not know much about newspapers;
I read so few of them. I have only one test for
them, and that is their suitability for wrapping up shooting
boots. And, judged by this standard, <i>The Times</i> is the best
newspaper.”</p>

<p class='c016'>It was not easy to get the better of Creighton, with his
humour to back up his wisdom and firmness. But my dear
old friend, the late Father Stanton, who was a frequent
visitor to Vagabond entertainments with F. E. Sidney, once
got the better of him, and he was very amusing in telling the
story of it.</p>

<p class='c016'>Creighton, it appears, went to a service of Stanton’s,
because he wished to wean him from certain ritualistic practices.
After the service was over, they had a talk in the
vestry, which was quite cordial, because Creighton knew
the essential greatness and goodness of Stanton’s character.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>Stanton, who was very astute and tactful about getting his
own way, and yet avoiding trouble with his Bishop, adroitly
kept the conversation away from dangerous points, and
finally the Bishop gave up, and called for his carriage. Stanton
escorted him to the carriage door, and as he was driving off,
Creighton got out what he had come to say.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I don’t like that incense of yours, Stanton.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Nor do I, my lord, it’s wretched stuff—only three and
sixpence a pound, but I can’t afford any better.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Do without it, Stanton, do without it altogether,” said
the Bishop.</p>

<p class='c016'>Lord Charles Beresford was another of our guests, and so
was Admiral Lambton. Both of them made a violent attack
on <i>Bridge</i>, which they said was sapping the energy of the
nation by the awful waste of time to which it led.</p>

<p class='c016'>Beresford was very amusing. He said, “The Navy is
the finest thing in the world for a man. If I hadn’t been in
the Navy, I should have been in prison.”</p>

<p class='c016'>I only once saw Beresford seriously put out, and that was
when he had to speak after that great man, Seddon, the
Premier of New Zealand, whose patriotic attitude about the
Boer War counted for so much in making the democratic
colonies support the mother country so splendidly against the
Boers. Seddon, like other New Zealanders I have known, could
make a great speech, but did not know when he had used up
all he had to say. In the first part of that speech for the
Vagabonds, he began with great éclat, and then maundered
on and on about “Womman,” as he pronounced her generic
name, while Beresford grew so impatient that when his
turn came to speak he excused himself with a few witty
sentences about their having heard so much good speaking.</p>

<p class='c016'>Seddon brought two charming daughters with him, and one
of them made a felicitous retort to a maladroit person who
condoled with her on her father’s not having been knighted
like the leader of the Conservative Opposition in New Zealand,
Sir William Russell, whose name had appeared in the Gazette
of the day before.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I don’t mind,” she said; “Billy’s a darling.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Norman Angell, the apostle of peace, in books like his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>famous <i>The Great Illusion</i>, and also the <i>Daily Mail</i> correspondent
of Paris, was our guest on one occasion.</p>

<p class='c016'>The most unexpected turns happened at times. One
night we had an athletic dinner, with C. B. Fry and Eustace
Miles for our chief guests, and Pett Ridge in the chair. There
was hardly a word talked about athletics the whole evening,
for Pett Ridge is most interested in work among the poor,
and so are Fry and Miles, and the speeches related almost
entirely to the serious side of the humorist and the athletes.
The world at large did not know how earnest Fry is about
good works until he refused to go to Australia in the all-England
Eleven because he could not leave his work on
naval training for boys until a certain sum was raised for the
training-ship. In those days it regarded him merely as one
of the greatest batsmen ever seen, and the only man who had
ever had five blues at the university, and been captain or
president of the university in three different kinds of games.
Some of them remembered too, that he was a Scholar of his
College, and got a First. None of them, I am quite sure,
knew that he would have been unable to go to Oxford at all,
because he had no money to go on, except his scholarship at
Wadham, if he had not borrowed the money, and repaid it
out of his own earnings after he left the university. Could
anything be more magnificent than that the man who holds
the record of all Englishmen, and for that matter, that of all
recorded men, for achievements in games, should have paid
for himself at the university? Yet there were some people
in the Club that night who expressed their disapproval to me
at the Club’s entertaining a mere athlete!</p>

<p class='c016'>But there were many more who expressed their disapproval
of our entertaining Christabel Pankhurst as our guest of the
evening—most of them ardent Radicals, who disliked the
practical jokes of the suffragettes upon Cabinet ministers.
We Conservatives felt no more sympathy for people who do
idiotic damage, but were more tolerant. I did not propose
the toast, although I was in the chair, and have always
desired to give the vote to women with the proper qualifications.
I called upon an old friend, a very successful barrister,
whom I suspect of being an ardent Liberal, though he is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>an ardent suffragist—Fordham Spence—to propose it. He
made the kind of points which could not fail to enlist the
sympathies of a popular audience—asking which of the men
who were present would have the pluck to go to prison and
starve themselves for a principle, as these women did. He
pointed dramatically to our guest, a pretty, slim girl, who
hardly looked out of her teens, and told us what she had done.
He was the clever advocate all through; he begged the question
almost as flagrantly as Miss Pankhurst herself, when
she got up to reply to the toast.</p>

<p class='c016'>I prefer to hear the arguments of the suffragists stated in
the dispassionate way in which Mrs. Fawcett states them,
pure appeals to reason and justice, stated without any attempts
to draw red herrings across the trail—in fact, stated
by a judge, instead of pleaded by an advocate. I think they
would be difficult to resist. The weak point of the militant
suffragettes is that they not only do things of which moderate
people cannot approve, to attract the public attention, but
they have no consideration for our commonsense; they talk
to us like Socialists talk to a mob in Trafalgar Square, not
as a great Scientist, like Lord Kelvin, would address the
British Association. That is the convincing way.</p>

<p class='c016'>I do not know if Miss Pankhurst made many converts to
the cause that night; she certainly made many personal
friends. An hour or two later I met her at a supper given by
Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Mappin at the Savoy, and had the good
fortune to sit next to her once more. She was off duty then,
and saying that she really must begin to play games again to
keep her “fit” for her work.</p>

<p class='c016'>Two of the most successful dinners we ever had were to
Captain Scott, the Antarctic explorer, and Ernest Thompson
Seton. At the Scott dinner the great hall of the Hotel
Cecil was packed to its utmost limits, though it was not due
to any premonition that he might not come back. Before
Scott perished the world had got into the idea that Arctic
and Antarctic exploration was not really so dangerous as
going out with a friend who was learning to drive a car. But
Scott had such an irresistible personality; he looked the very
type of man whose courage and resourcefulness and indomitable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>endurance would get him and those who depended on
him out of the tightest place. And he would have got his
party through if the supplies in the hut had been left at their
proper strength. Scott was one of those blue-eyed men
who can meet any danger with a smile, and are absolutely
devoid of fear. I never knew a man for whom I had a more
instinctive liking, or to whom I should so naturally turn for
support when facing death. Few men are such an asset to
their race as he was.</p>

<p class='c016'>Ernest Thompson Seton held his audience as no other
Vagabond guest has ever done. The born naturalist and the
natural orator are combined in him. He made a lecture,
which had probably done duty several times as a lecture, do
duty for his personal reply to the proposal of his health; it
did not betray its origin, and yet it was a moving plea for the
whole brute creation; he invested the lower animals, probably
unjustly, with all sorts of human traits and human feelings,
and made the audience feel for them as they feel for the
hero or heroine in a tragedy. It was really wonderful; I
never heard such a mixture of ingenuity and eloquence, or
a speech more thrillingly delivered. He is the apostle of
animated Nature.</p>

<p class='c016'>I was abroad when the Club entertained Lord Curzon and
Winston Churchill and Lord Leighton, but I was present
when Lord Willoughby de Broke made such a popular guest.
The position was rather a difficult one; not having noticed
the views which Jerome had been expressing on the House
of Lords to the local yokels, I asked him to take the chair,
because he was the most successful playwright in the club—he
had just produced <i>The Third Floor Back</i>—and our guest
was one of the best amateur actors. Jerome’s speech was
not marked by his usual verve; like Balaam, he had come to
curse, and he was so won over by the splendid manliness of
the guest that he was unable to do anything but bless. Lord
Willoughby de Broke would doubtless have given us a much
more entertaining evening if Jerome had spoken of him to us
as he spoke of his fellow-peers to the yokels, for no one is so
ready with a retort. Who does not remember his retort at
the meeting which he was addressing in favour of Mr. Balfour.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>He was saying something in praise of him, when a voice at
the back called out “Rats!” He smiled sweetly—“I was
speaking of Mr. Balfour,” he said, “not of the first Lord of
the Admiralty.”</p>

<div id='i174f'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i174f.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>G. B. BURGIN<br /><i>Drawn by Yoshio Markino</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c016'>Later on, at that same meeting, a heckler asked him where
he got his title, and was told “just where you got your d——d
ugly face—from my father.”</p>

<p class='c016'>He gave us some pretty flashes of wit that night, but not
of the scathing order which makes him one of the protagonists
who fight against Home Rule. With his physical strength
and activity, his dauntless courage, and his power of swaying
great assemblages with his speeches, he is a born leader.</p>

<p class='c016'>There were few well-known literary men and women in
the London of the time who were not guests of the Vagabonds
Club. The best speech we ever had from a woman author
was, I think, from Flora Annie Steel, who, contrary to the
habit of most speakers, explained to start with that she was
likely to make a very good speech because we had taken her
unexpectedly, and she was very angry with the last speaker—whom
she proceeded to mince.</p>

<p class='c016'>But charming Mrs. Craigie, “John Oliver Hobbes,” made
us a very fascinating one when she was our guest of the
evening. That was the night on which she complained that
people persisted in identifying her with her heroines, especially
with the kind of heroine whom a woman does not wish
to be suspected of drawing from herself, like her “Anne”
(I think in <i>The Gods, Some Mortals, and Lord Wickenham</i>).</p>

<p class='c016'>Anthony Hope, who was the next speaker, complained that
he had never had such luck, that he had been hoping ever
since he wrote <i>The Prisoner of Zenda</i> that somebody would
confuse him with Rupert of Hentzau, but that no critic had
ever obliged him.</p>

<p class='c016'>Once, at any rate, he was the guest of the Club, and he
occupied the chair, I should say, nearly every year during
its existence. I wish I had kept a record of the <i>bons mots</i>
which never failed to adorn his speeches. One of them comes
to my mind as I write these words; he said that the reason
why England and the United States were not better friends
arose from their inability to understand each other’s humour.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>He and Conan Doyle were the mainstays of our chair at
the New Vagabonds. Doyle may have taken it even oftener
than he did. He was the chairman we instinctively chose
for a great occasion, like that on which we had Lord Roberts
for our guest, though he did not actually take the chair that
night, for we could rely upon him to say the generous and
dignified words which would express the feelings of the Club,
as he did in proposing the health of Lord Roberts at the
Authors’ Society dinner, when he said that Lord Roberts
was the one guest who, short of royalty, must always take
the first place in any gathering of his countrymen, the first,
not only in rank and distinction, but in the grateful love and
veneration of Englishmen.</p>

<p class='c016'>Doyle was in the chair at the farewell dinner which the
Club gave in honour of Burgin and myself at the Connaught
Rooms, and said just exactly the right things to make us
feel very proud, and to voice the regret of the Club at meeting
for the last time. The Club did not exactly die, because it
was amalgamated with the O.P. Club.</p>

<p class='c016'>Carl Hentschel was a very prominent member of both clubs,
and when Burgin and I were unable to carry on the Vagabonds
any longer, he very kindly came forward, and was willing either
to take over the honorary secretaryship of the Vagabonds, or
to amalgamate the two clubs. Finally, seeing that Bohemians
had more dining clubs than they had the leisure to attend, we
decided in favour of amalgamation, and there is some talk
now of the Playgoers combining with them both.</p>

<p class='c016'>George Grossmith was one of our best members. We had
him as a guest, and he often gave us an entertainment. One
of his most felicitous efforts was when he proposed his own
health, and was very sarcastic about himself. But that
was a favourite vein of humour with him. Those who were
at the great party which he and Weedon gave at the Grafton
Galleries will remember the story of the clergyman’s wife
who was getting up a bazaar, and suggested that they should
ask George Grossmith to give them a performance, because
he was such a fool—“You can always get him to do things for
nothing,” she explained, and added, “The best of him is
that he can be humorous without being funny.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>She was right about his being generous; that was always
characteristic of George Grossmith.</p>

<p class='c016'>Bill Nye distinguished himself in an equally original
manner when he was the guest of the evening. It was
Independence Day, and he had enjoyed such a reception
from the American colony that he was sleepy, to say the least
of it, before he reached the New Vagabonds. Not one word
could the chairman get out of him during the dinner, but no
sooner had the chairman said, “Gentlemen, you may smoke,”
than Nye got up and returned thanks for all the handsome
things which had been said about him. He spoke at great
length, and with the greatest fluency, and it was only with
considerable difficulty that he could be stopped. He is the
only man I ever remember to have come to one of the dinners
so tired, though I have seen others unbend as the evening
grew old; and it was entirely due to the accident of his arriving
in London on Independence Day. And, as poor Phil May
said, of course, your tongue does sometimes run away with
you, when you are on your legs.</p>

<p class='c016'>Arthur Diósy (the son of that Martin Diósy who was
secretary of the Hungarian Revolution), who was chairman of
the Japan Society for years, had talked so learnedly about
Japan, and had mouthed the Japanese names so lovingly,
that every one imagined that he had been in Japan for at
least half his lifetime. Most people went further, and, not
knowing that the Hungarians were Mongols who conquered
parts of Europe a thousand years ago, imagined, from the
Mongolian type in his features, of which, as a Hungarian, he
was so proud, that he was a Japanese. Even the name did
pretty well if you spelt it wrong. When he did go to Japan
for the first time, and received an enormous welcome from the
Japanese authorities as the founder of the Japan Society,
and the practical originator of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance,
we, his fellow-members of the Vagabond Club, gave him a
dinner in honour of the event.</p>

<p class='c016'>I am an original member of the Japan Society, and had the
honour of giving them their opening address in the season of
1912.</p>

<p class='c016'>We had a very interesting guest in Sir George Scott Robertson,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>the doctor who was knighted for his successful defence
of Chitral when the combatant officers were all <i>hors de combat</i>.
Robertson not only wrote his name on the golden roll of the
besieged who have endured to the end and who have prevailed,
but he gave us one of the best speeches we had ever heard
at the Club. He told us marvels of his other claim on his
country—his exploration of Kafiristan, a country which
had kept its population pure from other strains, and had
preserved unique monuments until, in our own generation,
the Afghans began to absorb it, and he proved himself a
great orator, with a well of biblical English flowing into his
impromptu speech.</p>

<p class='c016'>Sir Edward Ward we entertained for his share in another
and yet more memorable defence, for it was to him, more
than anybody else, that England owes the preservation
of Ladysmith. He foresaw what was coming, and before it
was too late got on the track of everything edible and potable
in Ladysmith; he made the horses, which were not going to
be of any use, into chevril, a horsey form of Bovril, and if
the siege had gone on much longer, he would have found a
way of making <i>suprêmes</i> out of old boot-soles. He made
the provisions last by his foresight and administrative capacity,
and he was almost as invaluable with his indomitable pluck
and cheeriness. He was for years Permanent Secretary of
War, and it is a mighty pity that he is not Secretary
of State for War, for which his unparalleled knowledge
of Army administration and his robust commonsense would
make him the ideal appointment. No detail is too small
for Ward to attend to it; no person is too small for him
to listen to courteously and patiently. He made a great
impression on the Vagabonds, for he has an Irishman’s wit
in speaking, and is most soldierly looking, a man of Herculean
build.</p>

<p class='c016'>Sir George Reid, the High Commissioner of Australia, is
one of the best speakers we had at the Club; he is very witty
when he is witty, and from time to time turns serious with
marked effect. I had known him many years before he came
to the Vagabond dinner; I made his acquaintance in the
early ’eighties, when I held the Chair of History in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>University at Sydney, and he was the only Free-trader of
any influence in Australia. Since then he has been the
Premier of Federated Australia, and now most worthily
represents the Commonwealth, for he has impressed on the
Government that he is a force to be reckoned with, even
where the colonies are only vaguely affected.</p>

<p class='c016'>In decided contrast to him was the Princess Bariatinsky—Lydia
Yavorska, the Russian actress who married a cousin
of the Czar. We entertained her as a recognition of her
splendid acting in Ibsen’s <i>Doll’s-House</i>, where her foreign
accent was no drawback, and her tragic power had scope.</p>

<p class='c016'>There are other Vagabond dinners which, I remember,
went off with much éclat, though I cannot recall their incidents—dinners
to great sailors like Lord Charles Beresford
and Lambton, now Meux, and Shackleton of Antarctic fame,
dinners to great soldiers like Sir Evelyn Wood; dinners to
great artists like Lord Leighton and Sir Alma Tadema and
Linley Sambourne, all, unfortunately, now dead, and J. J.
Shannon, still with us and still young; dinners to great
actors like Ellen Terry and Tree, Wyndham and Mary Moore
and the younger Irvings and the Bourchiers and the Asches
and Forbes-Robertson and Lena Ashwell; and dinners to
great authors like Doyle, Mrs. Humphry Ward, Hall Caine,
H. G. Wells, Mrs. Burnett, Jerome, W. L. Courtney and
Robert Barr. They were all great occasions, with two, three
or four hundred present, but readers will wish to be spared
the details of dinners to perfectly well-known people unless
they brought out some fresh trait, or some priceless anecdote.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is to be hoped that the Vagabond dinners will come to
life again, not on the huge and expensive scale which is going
out of vogue, but little meetings of really eminent people
gathered at some restaurant in Soho, to eat a dinner which
reminds them of joyous Bohemian days in Paris or Italy, and
to enjoy the pleasures of a general conversation upon the
topics of Bohemia, such as we used to have in the days when
we met as men only (which we will never do again), before
we were reformed Vagabonds.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Argonauts, a little dining club which Frankfort
Moore and I founded, before the Vagabonds allowed ladies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>at their dinners, to dine every Sunday or every other Sunday
at Mrs. Robertson’s tea and luncheon rooms in Bond
Street, where we had our club-room, would give a good
example to follow. We seldom had a guest or speeches. A
number of well-known people used to dine together for the
pleasure of each other’s company. We left our places as
soon as we had finished dinner, and broke up into little knots
to converse. There you really could see your friends, and
introduce interesting people to each other.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c011'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c023' id='f7'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r7'>7</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The members of this club, as far as I can remember, were: Conan Doyle,
E. W. Hornung, Justin McCarthy, M.P., J. K. Jerome, S. R. Crockett, Anthony
Hope, Gilbert Parker, Oswald Crawfurd, W. H. Wilkins, J. Bloundelle-Burton,
Frankfort Moore, Moncure D. Conway, Rudolf Lehmann, Edward Heron

and Mrs. Oscar Beringer. To these I must add one of the two famous Greenes
who were singers; I cannot find the initial. It will be observed that there
was hardly a person in the club whose name was not well known.</p>
</div>

<p class='c016'>At these Vagabond dinners, the ordinary procedure was
for two or three or four hundred members, male and female,
to assemble to do honour to a famous guest. As soon as
dinner was over, the chairman proposed the health of the
King, and made the stereotyped joke about any lady, who
wished, being permitted to smoke. He had this excuse at
the Vagabonds, that many of the men smoked before they
had received permission. Then he proposed the health of
the guest, and the guest replied. All guests made the same
jokes about the name “Vagabonds.” I rather think that
they must have been supplied to them by the toast-master
at the Hotel Cecil, who always “prayed silence” with special
gusto for “Mr. Hanthony ’Ope,” because no other name
gave him the same chances.</p>

<p class='c016'>When the guest had finished his speech, which was usually
a very good one, because we chose them for their speaking,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>unless they were very eminent, we retired into the adjoining
hall for an entertainment of singing, story-telling and conjuring,
which I always thought spoilt the evening, much as
I appreciated the performances of men like Churcher and
Harrison Hill and Bertram, or Willie Nichol, or Reggie
Groome, for when you had a number of eminent people
collected together, far the best form of entertainment was
to introduce them to each other. I remember the positive
pain I felt at Lady Palmer’s, when, a few minutes after she
had introduced me to George Meredith for the first time,
Johannes Wolff, the violinist, played a thing of Beethoven’s
which was as long as a sermon. I wanted to hear George
Meredith so much more than him, having regarded him as
one of the greatest masters of literature all my life, and wishing
to surrender to the extraordinary charm of his way of speaking.
I sympathise with a famous tenor, who told me that the first
time he heard Handel’s <i>Messiah</i>, when they came to the
<i>Hallelujah Chorus</i>, he said, “Let’s get ‘oot,’ there’s going
to be a row.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Personally, I used to try and induce the most interesting
people present, except the guest of the evening, to stay
outside, and have whiskies and sodas. They generally
hadn’t the good taste to prefer singing to whiskies and
sodas; I hadn’t, either, though I don’t drink whisky.</p>

<p class='c016'>But the Hotel Cecil, where we held the Vagabond dinners,
was not as bad as the Savage Club. In the old days there,
if you did not wish to spend your evening glued to one chair,
listening to singing, you had to stand in a tiny bar, the size
of a scullery, and hear the same jokes from the same steady
drinkers, just as you would have heard the same songs every
Saturday evening if you had stayed in the room all the
time. The Savage is a much more literary club now, and the
accommodation is better arranged. I do not want to say
anything against the old Savage. Those performances were
good enough for anybody to listen to once, even King Edward
VII, who, when he was Prince of Wales, dined there, and
said that he had never enjoyed himself so much in his life.
What I objected to was the constant repetition of the same
performance Saturday after Saturday, without having any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>place for members to sit and talk if they did not want to
hear the music. But I have been to many Bohemian
dinners in my time, and I have not met many men, except
Walter Besant, who confessed that performances made him
feel, as they make me, that he would have a nervous breakdown
if he listened to them for half-an-hour longer. I have
noticed that most men, when they go to a club of this kind,
where there are a number of really eminent people in the
room, have no objection to listening to one vapid song after
another, instead of being introduced to, we will say, Lord
Kelvin, or Tennyson, or Sir Henry Irving, and this though
they could have an equally good performance any night of
their lives by paying for a seat in the promenade of a music-hall.
When will people understand that the two sorts of
entertainments ought to be kept separate—that the great
object of a literary dinner is for one to meet men who write,
or the people whom all the newspapers are writing about?
You can go to a concert by paying for it; you cannot meet
these people by any other means except introduction, and
the hour or two after you have done eating at a public dinner
is all too short a period for the chance of introduction to the
world’s workers.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> <br /><span class='c022'>LITERARY CLUBS: THE SAVAGE CLUB</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>I was</span> for a number of years a member of the Savage Club,
and I was an honorary member there for a long time at an
earlier period, when I first came home from Australia and
the waiting list was full.</p>

<p class='c016'>I sometimes hinted to the then secretary that I had out-lived
my month of honorary membership several times over.
His answer was invariably the same: “Rules are intended
to be enforced against disagreeable people.” I remained
an honorary member till I went away to America in 1888.
Some years afterwards, when I returned from America, I
became an ordinary member.</p>

<p class='c016'>At first I loved the Savage. There were not many author-members,
it was true, who ever put in an appearance, except
Christie Murray and Patchett Martin—Barrie was a member,
but he was never there. The Club did not run to authors.
What celebrities there were were chiefly actors and artists.
But it was a club that consisted more of the admirers of the
arts than their professors, men who packed the dinner-table
every Saturday night, and made an enthusiastic audience
for the actors and musicians and reciters, who did “turns”
to amuse the company and get their names known to the
public, if they were not already popular favourites, like
W. H. Denny, Fred Kay, Odell, Willie Nichol and Reggie
Groome.</p>

<p class='c016'>I have known the Savage Club long enough to remember
Brandon Thomas and Seymour Hicks being regarded as
brilliant amateurs, who never would be anything more.
But both were very favourite performers at giving sketches
accompanied by the piano. Penley was often there, but
never would perform. One of the favourite <i>jeunes premiers</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>of musical comedy—I forget which—used to sing “I’ll sing
thee Songs of Araby” every Saturday night.</p>

<p class='c016'>Before I went to America, while I knew hardly any one
in Bohemia, and it was all new to me, I loved those Saturday
nights. We had a bad half-crown dinner, in which I generally
sat between quite uninteresting people—well-off furniture
dealers and that kind of thing, who were most of them,
however, keen and intelligent patrons of music and the
drama, and belonged to the Savage for that reason. Most
of them, too, were old members, with a large number of
friends at whom they fired good-humoured banter across the
tables. I found them willing to take one into their good-fellowship
in the readiest manner, and occasionally one was
rewarded by finding oneself near an affable celebrity.</p>

<p class='c016'>But the conversation was seldom in the least bit intellectual.
Books were treated as non-existent in the Savage
of that day. There were hardly any, even in the library,
except poems given by the poets themselves. I was always
heartily glad when the dinner was over, and the fusillade
of ordering drinks was over, and the performance began.</p>

<p class='c016'>The club-house was situated then, as now, in Adelphi
Terrace, a fine row of Georgian houses standing on a sort of
marine parade above the bank of the Thames. If you looked
over the railings on the opposite side of the road, you would
expect to find a beach like Brighton’s. I have never yet
looked over these railings, so I don’t know what there is
below, but there must be vaults, which are used for something,
under the road, in such a valuable locality.</p>

<p class='c016'>The room where we held the dinners and these brilliant
club concerts was only separated by a wall from David
Garrick’s dining-room. He made the mistake of living in
the wrong house.</p>

<p class='c016'>The theory why we dined at 6.30, was that popular actors
and singers could dine with us, and give us a turn before
they went to their theatre. In practice, they very seldom
came, unless they were having a holiday, voluntary or
otherwise. But there were always enough of them “resting”
to give us a brilliant evening.</p>

<p class='c016'>For some little time after dinner the Club did not settle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>down sufficiently to make its favourite performers willing
to give their turns. It made too much noise over diluting
whisky with soda, and manœuvring to get the waiter’s
attention. This gave the new aspirant his chance. If he
was timid and low-voiced, he did not always get the attention
of the room, but it was not difficult to get the chairman to
call on him. I know by experience how difficult it was to
get any old “hand” to sing first. I called upon the bores
first, when I was in the chair. There were several of them,
whom the Club had grown into the habit of tolerating every
Saturday night, so they had earned a right to be called on.
They all said that they had colds, and afterwards, when the
performance was at its height, sent round notes that they
felt better, and would try to give a turn if I called upon them
now. But I ignored the notes so long as I had any one else
to call on. They were mostly reciters; almost any kind of
song will go in a club which takes up a chorus.</p>

<p class='c016'>Some of the humorous reciters were very good. The club
was never tired of hearing Robert Ganthony give a scene in
a Metropolitan Police Magistrate’s Court; or that youthful
octogenarian, Fitzgerald, the artist, mimicking a rehearsal
at Astley’s in the old days; or Odell, the idol of the Savage,
going through his wonderful repertoire. Early in the evening,
Walter Hedgcock, the Crystal Palace organist, would
give us the song he never could publish, because he was
blocked by an earlier setting—Kipling’s “Mandalay.” It
was delightful music, and was eventually published as the
“Mousmee,” with words which I wrote for him in the metre
of “Mandalay.” Hedgcock did not mind coming on early,
because he could always pick up the audience with the first
bars of “Mandalay.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Townley, who was Registrar of Births and Deaths at
St. Pancras, I think—except on Saturday nights and Sundays—was
our funniest singer; he was a natural comedian. The
Club always insisted on its favourites singing the same songs.
He had to sing a song called “Hoop-la,” or something of the
kind. Willie Nichol had to sing “Loch Lomond”; Cheesewright
had to sing “The Three Jolly Sailor-Boys”; Denny,
who was afterwards our honorary secretary, did generally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>give us something recent from the music-halls. But the old
“hands” eyed him half resentfully while he did it.</p>

<p class='c016'>I soon came to regard Odell as an oasis, because, though
the Club made him sing and recite the same things Saturday
after Saturday, he had a blessed gift of gag. In the midst of
his ballad about the Fleet, the one Warham St. Leger wrote
for <i>Punch</i>, he stopped one night to tell us how he lost his
last engagement. It was in a piece based on the wreck of the
<i>Princess Alice</i>, the Thames steamer in which so many lives
were lost. Odell played the part of captain of the steamer,
and all went well till one night, as he expressed it, just at
the fatal moment, when the people in the stalls were taking
off their coats because they were so perspiring with excitement,
he could stand the tension no longer, so he took out his
watch and said, “It’s just five o’clock. I wish I had gone
back by the penny ’bus.” The audience rose in their places,
and stoned him with whatever came handy, and he pretended
that after that he never could get an engagement.</p>

<p class='c016'>As I don’t drink after dinner, and don’t smoke at all,
I began to find these concerts very tiring as soon as I knew
all the performances by heart. But there was no other
place of meeting except the bar. We badly needed a smoking-room,
adjoining the dining-room and the bar, where those
who had brought interesting people with them could introduce
them to interesting Savages, without losing touch with the
evening, as they did if they went up to that melancholy
library, which has probably been given over to some legitimate
purpose, like <i>Bridge</i>, long ago.</p>

<p class='c016'>I frequently agitated for this smoking-room, and I believe
that they got it eventually. The bar did too good a business;
you did not see people getting intoxicated; its habitués
carried their liquor too well. But I have seen one man
drink as many as thirty-three whiskys-and-sodas in a single
evening, and I saw him the other day—twenty years afterwards—looking
as fit as possible.</p>

<p class='c016'>Gradually I came to the conclusion that as there were
so many other interesting things happening on Saturdays,
it was not wise to give my Saturday evenings up to the
Savage, and there was “nothing else to” the club in those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>days. It had not then become the favourite lunching-place
of the great editors, an important venue for authors.</p>

<p class='c016'>So I retired from the Savage, as I retired from the Devonshire
a few years afterwards. When one of the committee
of the Devonshire asked me why I retired from it, I said
that I only used it for funerals, and that I was retiring
because they had made that an extra. This was a fact.
The windows of the Devonshire Club are one of the best
places for seeing a royal funeral—or, of course, any other
royal procession. The committee discovered this, and put
on a charge of ten pounds a seat, to pay for the decorations
of the Club. So many people wanted these seats that they
had to be balloted for. The action of the committee was
justified. But, as I had not used the Club since the funeral
of Queen Victoria, when I found that I could not see the
funeral of King Edward from its windows without balloting
for the privilege of paying ten pounds for it, I sent in my
resignation, and paid a guinea for a seat from which I could
see the funeral for the whole length of Oxford and Cambridge
Terrace. I went with Norma Lorimer and Markino, who
painted a wonderful picture of it. The people on whose
roof we hired the seats from the contractor, asked us to
lunch, and became quite intimate friends. They proved
to be Mr. Sanderson Stuart and his daughter—the youthful
genius of sculpture.</p>

<p class='c016'>We used to get most notable guests at the Savage—was
not the list headed by Albert Edward, Prince of Wales. I
was in the chair the night that Nansen was the guest of the
evening. It was on the eve of his departure for the North
Pole, and I hammered the table and asked the Club if they
would allow me to invite our guest to write his name on the
wall behind his seat, to remain there till he came back again.
They assented with rapturous applause, and the name is
there still, glazed over. I have told in another chapter what
he said to the “Savage” who wished to accompany him to
the Arctic Circle.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Savage Club is, undoubtedly, one of the institutions
of London, and every literary visitor to these shores should
see one of its Saturday nights.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <br /><span class='c022'>MY CONNECTION WITH JOURNALISM</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>I must</span> allude briefly to my long connection with journalism.</p>

<p class='c016'>When I settled in London in 1891, I had already done a
good deal of journalism in New York and San Francisco. In
the latter my writing had chiefly lain in travel-articles on
Japan, to which San Francisco, as the Pacific Capital of the
United States, naturally looks. In New York I had written
on travel—much of my <i>Japs at Home</i> appeared in travel-articles
for the McClure Syndicate. But I also wrote a
number of literary and personal articles for the <i>New York
Independent</i>, the <i>Sun</i>, the <i>World</i>, and so on, such as my
<i>Reminiscences of Cardinal Newman</i> told in the first person.
In doing this I found that what America demanded was the
personal reminiscence.</p>

<p class='c016'>When I came to England, I naturally sought work on the
same lines, and had no difficulty in finding editors who saw
the opening for this comparatively fresh line in British
journalism.</p>

<p class='c016'>I turned first to Fisher, of the <i>Literary World</i>, whom I
had met at the Idler teas, and who had invited me to do some
reviewing for him. He had <i>Table-Talk Notes</i> as a feature,
and here my first journalism appeared.</p>

<p class='c016'>When I was helping Jerome to formulate <i>To-day</i> in 1893,
I suggested to him that we should have a book of the week,
in which we told as much about the author as we knew, and
that biographical gossip about authors and artists and actors
should be one of our chief features. He was completely in
favour of it, and I wrote a good deal for him, especially about
authors.</p>

<p class='c016'>About the same time, Lewis Hind became editor of the
now defunct <i>Pall Mall Budget</i>, and I carried out the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>idea for him in a regular <i>causerie</i>, to which we gave the name
of the <i>Diner-Out</i>, and which I signed “St. Barbe”—the
family name of my maternal grandmother.</p>

<p class='c016'>Between these three papers I was pretty fully occupied.
But my mind was turning towards a more congenial form
of journalism—the travel-article. Percy Cox, a son of
the Horace Cox whose name appeared on the <i>Queen</i> as its
publisher for so many years, was anxious to develop its
travel side, and while the late Sievers Drewett was organising
the wonderful travel department, which now has its annual
<i>Queen Book of Travel</i>, he employed me to write a series of
articles on my travels in Greece and Turkey, and a regular
travel-serial on the trans-continental journey across Canada,
which I amplified and brought out as <i>On the Cars and Off</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>While I was doing these, Clement Shorter, who had been
a sort of literary editor to the <i>Queen</i>—all the important
books being sent to him, and he writing a sort of <i>causerie</i>
about them—became too busy with his offspring, the <i>Sketch</i>,
to do any more work for the <i>Queen</i>, and I was offered his
place. My suggestion that we should have a signed “book
of the week” for the most important book—unsigned minor
reviews to be worked in anywhere about the paper—and
that I should do my <i>Diner-Out</i> column for the <i>Queen</i>, instead
of the <i>Pall Mall Budget</i>, was accepted, and I began my
literary connection with the <i>Queen</i>, which lasted for so many
years. I kept the <i>Diner-Out</i> for biographical gossip about
authors chiefly, and for announcements of forthcoming
books, which could be made interesting by personal gossip.
Actual reviewing I kept as far as possible out of that column.
In those days, though the <i>Queen</i> was and always had been the
chief ladies’ paper, it had not nearly so many departments
of feminine interest as it has now, so there was plenty of
space for book-reviewing, which became a very important
feature of the paper. I was only responsible for the <i>Book
of the Week</i> and the <i>Diner-Out</i>, though I did perhaps a
page of unsigned minor reviews, which were never attributed
to me.</p>

<p class='c016'>I had one faithful reader in her late Majesty, Queen
Victoria. I learned this quite incidentally. I had taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>a <i>manoir</i> in Brittany for the summer, and at the house of
Mrs. Burrowes, a niece of the late Lord Perth, met the lady
who filled the post of reader to Her Majesty; Queen Victoria
prefered having books and newspapers read aloud to her.
This lady informed me that Her Majesty had my <i>Diner-Out</i>
column in the <i>Queen</i> read to her every week, and was most
amused by it.</p>

<p class='c016'>As the woman’s side of the paper developed, the space for
reviewing became more and more restricted, and the <i>Diner-Out</i>
became simply a column of small reviews, without any
of its own features, and finally, I think, the name itself very
often dropped out.</p>

<p class='c016'>While I was doing the reviewing for the <i>Queen</i>, we were
travelling a great deal in France, Italy, Sicily and Egypt.
The books which I published on these countries were, as
far as the travel portion of them was concerned, largely
drawn from these articles in the <i>Queen</i>—beginning with
<i>Brittany for Britons</i>. Some of them, such as the Normandy
articles, I never did re-publish, and I contributed to the
<i>Queen</i> enough articles on Italy to form another volume,
besides those which have already appeared in my books on
Italy and Sicily.</p>

<p class='c016'>I still do some reviewing for the <i>Queen</i>, but I do little other
journalism now, except when I am approached by some
newspaper to do an article on a subject upon which I have
special knowledge.</p>

<p class='c016'>The fact is, that in recent years I have employed my
journalistic faculties on the preparation of books like <i>Who’s
Who</i>, <i>Sladen’s London and Its Leaders</i> and <i>The Green Book
of London Society</i>, which need much the same kind of gifts
as personal journalism does.</p>

<div id='i191f'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i191f.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>SIDNEY LOW<br /><i>Drawn by Yoshio Markino</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c016'><i>The Green Book</i> was a sort of one-line <i>Who’s Who</i>, which
only mentioned the leading people in each walk of London
life, except the bearing of a title. The selection of the chief
personages and experts in each line—say, for instance,
shooting or fishing or golf or writing books—was not made
by any correspondence with the people themselves, but was
entrusted to the chief expert in each line. Golf was by a
runner-up for the Amateur Championship, fishing by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>fishing editor of the <i>Field</i>, exploration by the secretary of
the Royal Geographical Society, and so on.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Who’s Who</i> itself must form the subject of a separate
chapter.</p>

<p class='c016'>I have no older friend in journalism than Sidney Low.
We went to Oxford, I think, on the same day—he was a
Scholar of Balliol and I was a Scholar of Trinity—and we
certainly knew each other very well there, and have been
intimate friends ever since. His ability received early
recognition. Before he had left Oxford ten years, he was
editor-in-chief of a great London daily, and he has written
books which have become standard works, like the <i>Dictionary
of English History</i>, which has been through half-a-dozen
editions. Since he gave up editing he has represented the
leading papers on the most important special missions. He
has been an alderman of the London County Council, and he
has been one of the chief forces in literary society. If I
were asked who had introduced me to the largest number of
eminent persons, I should say Sidney Low—without hesitation.
No man passes saner or more moderate judgments
on the great questions of the hour. Indeed, I should say
that Low stands in journalism for what a man who was at
Oxford with both of us—George Cave, K.C., M.P.—stands
in politics—for moderation in statement, combined with
great firmness of principle and judgment.</p>

<p class='c016'>With Low’s name I must couple that of the late Samuel
Henry Jeyes, who was his colleague both on the <i>St. James’s
Gazette</i> and the <i>Standard</i>. He was a beloved friend of us
both, but my intimacy with him began much earlier. He
was my greatest friend at Trinity, Oxford, and one of the
Oxford men of whom I saw most in after life. We were
elected Scholars of Trinity on the same day; we had rooms
on the same staircase; we went to all the same lectures till
we passed mods., and I taught him to play billiards. It
was the only game of manual skill which he ever did play.
He lashed the adulation for sport which prevails at Oxford
with the gibes of which he was such a master. When we
had only been up at Oxford for a few days, A. J. Webbe,
who was the special idol of Trinity because he was captain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>of the ’Varsity Eleven, asked all of us Trinity freshmen
to meet some of the lions of the Oxford Eleven. All of us
except Jeyes were vastly elated. We all, except Jeyes,
talked our best cricket shop to make a good impression on
the demigods. At last he could stand it no longer, and,
waiting till there was a dead pause in the conversation, he
said, “This b——y cricket!” I can remember the tableau
still.</p>

<p class='c016'>His reputation as a wit came up with him from Uppingham.
All Uppingham men could remember how, when he was
caught cribbing with a Bible on his knee at a Greek Testament
lesson, and his class-master had said to him triumphantly,
“What have you there, Jeyes?” he said, “A book,
sir, of which no man need be ashamed,” and how when
Thring, the greatest head master of his time, had asked him
how he came to be ploughed in arithmetic for his Oxford
and Cambridge certificate, he replied from Shakespeare,
“I cannot reckon, it befits the spirit of a tapster”—a
readiness which Thring would have been the first to appreciate.</p>

<p class='c016'>Among the best things I remember him saying at Oxford
are his definition of the Turks in a great debate over the
Bulgarian atrocities, as a people “whose morals are as loose
as their trousers, and whose vices are as many as their
wives.” And it was he who said, “I don’t want to go to
Heaven, because Gore (now Bishop of Oxford) is the only
Trinity man who will be there, and I’d rather be with the
rest.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Jeyes never spoke at the Union—he despised it—or he
would have been as great a success as the miraculous
Baumann or Freeman, now Rector of Burton-on-Trent.
I never remember hearing Cave speaking at the Union,
though perhaps he did.</p>

<p class='c016'>One of Jeyes’ wittiest retorts was to “Bobby” Raper,
at that time Dean of Trinity, who was “hauling” him
for some meretricious disregard of College discipline. The
glib excuse was not wanting, but Raper was stern. “No
no, Mr. Jeyes, that won’t do. You told me the exact
opposite of that last term.” “I know I did, Mr. Dean,
but that was a lie.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>He owed the Dean one, for the first thing he did when he
went up to Trinity had been to go and call on the Dean and
tell him that he had conscientious scruples against going
to chapel.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Morning chapel, you know, Mr. Jeyes,” said the Dean,
“is a matter of discipline and not of religion, but if you
really have conscientious objections, I’ll put on a roll-call for
you at 7 a.m.”—Chapel was at 8 a.m., so Jeyes swallowed
his nausea.</p>

<p class='c016'>But Jeyes’ wit was tireless. He was a fine scholar—he
made his pupils write wonderful Latin prose when he became
a don at University—I presume during the undergraduacy
of Lord Hugh and Lord Robert Cecil. But he tore himself
away to be a journalist, and became in time an assistant-editor
of the <i>St. James’s Gazette</i>, and later of the <i>Standard</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>As a journalist he was distinguished by incorruptibility
of no common sternness. Though he had always spoken as
a Liberal at Oxford (very likely out of malice, because all his
friends were Conservatives), he was one of the pillars of
Conservative journalism. He knew all the chiefs of the
Conservative party, and enjoyed great influence with them.
He was so rugged and unbending. I never knew a harder
editor to “work.” He wrote a Spartan life of Chamberlain,
for whom he had a great admiration, except in the matter
of Tariff Reform.</p>

<p class='c016'>He married an old friend of ours, the beautiful Viva
Sherman, an American nearly related to the Senator-Vice-President
and the General. Both before and after his
marriage he was a frequent visitor at our house, and we often
met at Ranelagh and elsewhere. He enjoyed a discussion
with Norma Lorimer. Her wit provoked his, and their
conversations were most brilliant to listen to.</p>

<p class='c016'>At last poor Jeyes was struck down with cancer—aggravated,
I believe, by cigar-smoking, in which he was a noted
connoisseur. He bore it with magnificent fortitude, and
for a long time kept it a secret. Even I did not know that
he had been mortally ill till he was dead. But I was one of
the three old Oxford friends who stood by his grave—his
oldest friend, except H. B. Freeman, who read the service.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>Sidney Low was the other. Charles Boyd was there too,
but he belonged to a much younger generation.</p>

<p class='c016'>If Jeyes had known that his life would be so short, he
would perhaps have devoted more time to book-writing.
It is a pity—except for his country and the Conservative
party—that he gave up so much of his life to necessarily
ephemeral journalism. I always heard that but for a flaw
in a will he would have been owner of one of the greatest
provincial journals in England.</p>

<p class='c016'>Peace be to his ashes. He was a merry soul, and if the
theosophists are right about our astral bodies meeting the
spirits of the departed, there is no one with whom I should
so much enjoy an astral conversation as Jeyes. He would
be such a volatile spirit. I can imagine the naïveté with
which he would describe his experiences.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Rev. Herbert Bentley Freeman—the Rector of Burton-on-Trent—a
cousin of the historian, and a descendant, I
believe, of the mighty Bentley of Phalaris renown, came up
to Trinity from Uppingham in the same term as Jeyes.
Freeman and A. A. Baumann, who was afterwards Conservative
M.P. for Peckham, were the two most brilliant
speakers at the Union in my day. The undergraduates
said that both wrote their speeches beforehand, and learned
them by heart and practised their delivery.</p>

<p class='c016'>Years afterwards I met Baumann when he had given up
his safe seat at Peckham and unsuccessfully contested a seat
in the North, I think at Manchester.</p>

<p class='c016'>“What made you give up Peckham?” I asked. “They
would have gone on electing you there as long as you lived.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“My dear chap, life isn’t worth living when you are
member for Peckham. I live in South Kensington, and
while I was member for Peckham I used to find my hall
full of constituents by the time I came down for breakfast,
and by lunch-time you’d have thought that I was having
an auction of my furniture.”</p>

<p class='c016'>But of all the men who were at Oxford with me, no one
has been so prominent, then and now taken together, in
intellectual circles as W. L. Courtney. Courtney was then
a rather young New College don, who had the distinction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>of being married to an extremely smart-looking wife. That
would have been a distinction by itself in the Oxford of
that day, for few were married in a way suitable to impress
undergraduates. Added to that, he cut the most eminent
figure in athletics of any don in Oxford. He was the
treasurer of the University Boat Club, while the dons respected
him as the ablest man in Oxford at philosophy.
I was not there when he gave it all up to come to London
and be literary editor of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> and editor of
the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, but I can imagine the consternation
which fell upon that ancient seat of learning when their
bright particular star, the admiration alike of don and
undergraduate, “chucked it,” as they say, for journalism.
Of course he did wisely, for in an incredibly short space of
time he had as distinguished a position in London as he had
had at Oxford. His influence on literature has been immense.
He has stood for the combination of scholarliness and up-to-dateness.
His own books range from essays on the verge
of fiction to some of the most important works on philosophy
published in his generation. Incidentally, the creator of
<i>Egeria</i> is our best dramatic critic, and a writer of plays.</p>

<p class='c016'>Both the late and the present editors of the <i>Field</i>, William
Senior and Theodore Andrea Cook, came to our Addison
Mansions receptions. That delightful man, William Senior,
the “Red Spinner” of fishing journalism, and his wife
came very often to us. Theodore Andrea Cook is the ideal
editor for a great sporting paper like the <i>Field</i>, for he had
not only been editor of a great daily, but he had rowed in
the Oxford boat, and been a Scholar of his College, and he
had captained the all-England team in the international
fencing matches at the Olympic games which were held
at Athens. He has also written very sound books on an
unusual variety of subjects (one of which, his book on
<i>The Spiral in Nature and Art</i>, was most widely discussed);
and is one of the most delightful writers we have of travel-books
on France. Of course, everything which he has written
upon sport is <i>ex cathedra</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>Walter Jerrold, who lives a little higher up the river than
I do, in an old house with a great garden, a very old friend,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>and a much older Vagabond than I, often came with his
wife to us at Addison Mansions. Jerrold is a grandson of
the famous wit, Douglas Jerrold. He was for more than
a dozen years sub-editor of the <i>Observer</i>. But fortunately
he found time for editing of another nature as well, which
will help his own books to give him a permanent place in
our literature. He is one of our best editors of nineteenth-century
classics; his biographical and bibliographical introductions
are the most useful of their kind—just what you
would expect from the grandson of a man who was a star
in the firmament of which he writes.</p>

<p class='c016'>Clement Shorter, who married the Irish poetess, and was
editor of the <i>Illustrated London News</i> when we met at
Rudolph Lehmann’s in the “nineties,” is another editor of
books as well as papers. The Brontës are his special protégés.
He is the acknowledged Brontë expert, and every one has
read his new book on George Borrow. He has been great at
founding—he not only founded the <i>Sketch</i>, the <i>Sphere</i> and
the <i>Tatler</i>, but he was one of the founders of the <i>Omar
Khayyam Club</i>, beloved of Radical litterateurs, though it
deals not with English politics, but English Persics. Here
you are always sure of good speaking—Mr. Balfour and
Mr. Asquith, and all the important Cabinet Ministers and
ex-Cabinet Ministers have spoken there on occasion. I have
never heard Shorter speak himself, but I understand that
he is a very good political speaker, and I can picture him
telling a Lincolnshire audience how wrong it is to have an
income not half as great as his own, for Shorter has been
deservedly prosperous. He is a great journalist—one of
the pioneers of modern journalism. He was a Civil Service
clerk when in 1890 he became editor of the <i>Illustrated London
News</i>, and only a couple of years had passed before he
started the <i>Sketch</i>, the model of a new class of paper, for the
same office, and continued to edit both papers till 1900.
Then he thought that he would like to have a paper of his
own, and raised a hundred thousand pounds to found the
<i>Sphere</i> and the <i>Tatler</i>, with which he has been associated
ever since, as editor of the former and director of both.
They are rightly among the most popular illustrated papers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>of the day, for they have reduced the handling of the personal
element to a science, and Shorter always was a brilliant
editor. His success has been largely due to his colossal
energy and industry. He has taken a minute interest in
every detail of the production of both papers.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the midst of all his journalistic labours, Shorter has
found time to write some admirable books, and has made
himself with two books a specialist on Napoleon in his period
of exile at St. Helena.</p>

<p class='c016'>Herbert White, the present editor of the <i>Standard</i>, is one
of the best informed of all the English newspaper editors
about Continental politics, because he went through such
an arduous schooling in Austria and Germany, and knows
German as well as he knows English. He married the
niece of an Austrian political leader, and after war-correspondenting
in the Græco-Turkish war of 1897, represented
leading English, American and French newspapers at Vienna
from 1897 to 1902, and Berlin from 1903 to 1911. Besides this
he has taken twenty special journalistic missions in every
country of the Continent except France and Russia.</p>

<p class='c016'>I should be accused of sycophancy if I said all I should
like to say of Robertson Nicoll, of whom I saw a good deal
before we were both such busy men. But there are some
things about Nicoll to which nobody can be blind, besides
the position of respect which he enjoys in the literary community.
He makes a <i>bona fide</i> attempt to educate his party
in politics, and his public in a spirit of commonsense and
toleration instead of appealing to their prejudices, and no
man has done more in the way of securing the publication
of the books of unknown authors of merit, who have justified
his expectations and given the world great books. Nicoll
has been the sincere and enthusiastic friend of merit. I can
say this without prejudice, because his firm have published
nothing of mine.</p>

<p class='c016'>Similarity of name, and their common friendship with the
A. S. Boyds, makes me mention here James Nicol Dunn,
whose editorship of the <i>Morning Post</i> was marked by such
an advance in the political weight of that paper. Dunn was
managing editor of the <i>National Observer</i> in its prime. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>solid efficiency as a journalist, he had no superior in the
country. It would have been a bad day for England when
he left it to edit the <i>Johannesburg Star</i>, if it had not been so
important that the chief organ of the Transvaal should be in
such brave, moderate and judicious hands, at such a critical
period in the history of South Africa.</p>

<p class='c016'>T. P. O’Connor is a very old friend of mine. I met him
first when we were both in America in 1888-1889, and we have
been on terms of Christian names ever since. Though we
differ strongly in politics, it has never affected our friendship,
for T. P. is very fair to his enemies, except when he happens
to have a special hatred for them. He has founded four
papers—the <i>Star</i>, the <i>Sun</i>, <i>T. P.’s Weekly</i> and <i>M. A. P.</i>—but
I am not sure as to how far he is still interested in any
of them.</p>

<p class='c016'>T. P. is to me a fascinating personality. He is so generous
and genial. The swift recognition, the ready smile, the
warm affectionate manner, have endeared him to hosts of
friends, and every one recognises that he has a golden pen
which invests everything he touches with interest, and an
acute intelligence—acute enough to sift even the Humbert
mystery and present a clear analysis of it, as witness his
<i>Phantom Millions</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>He is a golfer too, and once upon a time used to play with
W. G. Grace, who, it seems, in spite of his being the best
cricketer that ever lived, always hits his shot along the ground
except from the tee, though he drives and puts pretty well.
I got this egregious piece of journalism from him when we
were sitting next to each other at the dinner given by
M. Escoffier, at that time, and probably still, cook at the
Carlton Hotel, who gave a gourmet’s feast on the occasion
of the publication of his book on cookery, published by
Heinemann. Heinemann invited me. The chief thing I
remember about the feast is that the wine Escoffier selected
was <i>Pommery Naturel</i>, and that the <i>tour de force</i> was lamb
stuffed with sage and onions to replace the usual mint
sauce.</p>

<p class='c016'>John Malcolm Bulloch, the editor of the <i>Graphic</i>, who
gave me such immense assistance when I was writing <i>Adam</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span><i>Lindsay Gordon and His Friends in England and Australia</i>,
is an author whose father and grandfather were authors
before him. His specialities are the ancient University of
Aberdeen, of which he is an M.A., and the great house of
Gordon. He edited the <i>House of Gordon</i> for the New Spalding
Club, and has written many pamphlets on Gordon genealogy
besides his book on <i>The Gay Gordons</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>I happen to enjoy the friendship of the editors of both
the <i>Bookseller</i> and the <i>Publishers’ Circular</i>. George H.
Whitaker, who is a doctor by profession, saw a good deal
of the world as a ship’s doctor when he was a young man.
Now the world sees a good deal of him as head of the firm
which publishes <i>Whitaker’s Almanack</i>, as well as editor of
the <i>Bookseller</i>—famed, as a trade-organ ought to be, for
the justice of its reviews.</p>

<p class='c016'>R. B. Marston, who edits the <i>Publishers’ Circular</i>, edits
the <i>Fishing Gazette</i> also. He founded the Fly Fishers’ Club.
The Marstons are famous fishermen—his father, Edward
Marston, who has just died at a Nestor’s age, had been one of
Izaak Walton’s chief followers both with pen and rod. R. B.
is, besides writing books on fishing and photography, one of
the chief writers on our food supplies in war, an energetic
and patriotic public man.</p>

<p class='c016'>My oldest acquaintance in journalism, except Sidney
Low, is Penderel Brodhurst, the editor of the <i>Guardian</i>.
We used to meet at Henley’s in the days before I went to
America, which was in 1888. He was in those days the walking
encyclopædia of the <i>St. James’s Gazette</i>, and afterwards
edited the long-defunct <i>St. James’s Budget</i>. He was, as he
is, a man wrapped up in his work: he could, if he had chosen,
have been a personage in literary society on his very historical
name, for he is a descendant of the Penderel who saved King
Charles II in the oak at Boscobel, and enjoys a pension
therefor, probably one of the oldest pensions still running
in England, and he is, though he does not use his title, an
Italian marquis (Penderel de Boscobel, created 1782).</p>

<p class='c016'>Lindsay Bashford, being literary editor of the <i>Daily Mail</i>,
has only had time to write one book—<i>Everybody’s Boy</i>—but
that was a very good one. But he has a sufficient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>literary record apart from that, for he was lecturer on English
literature at a French university.</p>

<p class='c016'>J. A. Spender, the editor of the <i>Westminster</i>, is another
author-editor. I have known him for many years. He
comes of a brilliant family, for he is a son of Mrs. J. K.
Spender, and brother of Harold Spender. He was an
Exhibitioner of Balliol, and Harold was an Exhibitioner
of University College, Oxford. Both of them are authors
of half-a-dozen books, and both of them are wonderfully
clever and well-informed men, real powers in journalism.</p>

<p class='c016'>Sir Owen Seaman, of <i>Punch</i>, who was Captain of Shrewsbury
School, and took a First in the Classical Tripos, and
the Porson Prize at Cambridge, can best be described as the
modern Calverley, for no one since Calverley has written such
brilliant satirical lyrics. He was the “O. S.” of the <i>National
Observer</i>, and who does not remember “The Battle of the
Bays,” “In Cap and Bells” and “Borrowed Plumes”?</p>

<p class='c016'>H. W. Massingham, of the <i>Nation</i>, the most conspicuous
political journalist on the Liberal side, one of the few Liberals
who dare to try and lead their party against its will, has only
written a couple of books, both rather technical, <i>The London
Daily Press</i> and <i>Labour and Protection</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>Sidney Paternoster, the assistant-editor of <i>Truth</i>, is well
known as a novelist, as is Adcock, of the <i>Bookman</i>, but, taken
as a whole, editors of great newspapers are not writers of
books.</p>

<p class='c016'>Ernest Parke, director of the <i>Daily News</i> and <i>Leader</i> and
the <i>Star</i>, was at one time a regular attendant at the Vagabond
banquets, as was his sub., Hugh Maclaughlan. Parke
and I saw the Coronation together from a seat in the triforium
of Westminster Abbey right over the little square
of Oriental carpet on which His Majesty King George V
was crowned, so we had a splendid view of the Archbishop
of Canterbury and the Garter King-at-Arms, addressing
the North, South, East and West as witnesses, and of the
Dukes of Beaufort and Somerset, towering above Lord
Kitchener as he walked between them, an object lesson
which I suppose was not unintended. Parke is a great
journalist, and made the <i>Star</i> a force in literature. Leonard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>Rees, of the <i>Sunday Times</i>, who shines as a literary critic
as well as a musical critic, with whom I have had much
correspondence, I have never met personally. But Vivian
Carter, who was on the staff of the Institution of Civil
Engineers till only a dozen years ago, and has in the last
five years edited the <i>Bystander</i> with such conspicuous success,
is a mutual friend of the C. N. Williamsons and myself.
We meet there.</p>

<p class='c016'>J. S. Wood, the founder and managing director of the
<i>Gentlewoman</i>, and one of the real founders of the Primrose
League, was often from the beginning at our at-homes,
with his pretty Italian wife, and his daughters as they grew
up. We used to meet them in the season at Ranelagh, too.
Wood has been much more than a founder and editor of
newspapers, for he has been connected with the management
of several of our most important charities, and has himself
been instrumental in raising a quarter of a million for them.</p>

<p class='c016'>All the Kenealys (Arabella and Annesley, both authors,
Edward and Noel, both editors) were frequent visitors at
our flat, except Alexander Kenealy, the editor of the <i>Daily
Mirror</i>, who was in America for twenty years before he became
news editor of the <i>Daily Express</i>, and, later, editor of the
<i>Mirror</i>. More than any of the others, Alexander Kenealy
inherits the splendid abilities of his father, the famous
Dr. Kenealy, Q.C., M.P., one of the greatest lawyers of his
time, who took up the case of the Tichborne claimant
when others had abandoned it as hopeless, and almost
pulled him through.</p>

<p class='c016'>Another of our editor friends was Edwin Oliver, at that
time editor of <i>Atalanta</i> and subsequently of the <i>Idler</i>, and,
since 1910, of the widely influential <i>Outlook</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>I cannot conclude my chapter on journalism without
reference to Sir Hugh Gilzean-Reid, whose pet plaything
was the Institute of Journalists. He used often to come to
our house with his charming daughters. Sir Hugh, who
had made a considerable fortune out of journalism, large
enough to let him live in Dollis Hill, the house near Willesden
which Lord Aberdeen lent to Mr. Gladstone, never forgot
the working journalist, and it was he who engineered the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>agitation which defeated the intention of two of the great
London dailies to issue Sunday editions like the American
<i>Sunday World</i> and <i>Sunday Sun</i>. As Herbert Cornish was
the creator, he was chief founder and first President of the
Institute of Journalists also. He used to give large garden-parties
at Dollis Hill, chiefly to people who appreciated its
having been consecrated by the residence of Mr. Gladstone,
though there were others, like ourselves, who went because
we liked his family so much. He was a philanthropic man,
and did an immense amount of good.</p>

<p class='c016'>The first paid journalism I ever did was writing articles
on public school life for the <i>Educational Reporter</i> when I
was a boy at Cheltenham. About the same time I wrote a
story for <i>Bow Bells</i> called “Douglas Thirlstaine’s Wooing,”
which was not paid for, and soon after that I supplied unpaid
notes about Cheltenham College to a Cheltenham paper,
which had never been able to get them, as a favour to the
late Frederick Stroud, who had got me out of the libel action
brought by the editors of the <i>Shotover Papers</i>. I wish I
could find that libel now. It was a small pamphlet of a few
pages, published under the title of <i>Overshot</i> by a printer in
Turl Street, Oxford. I saw about the printing of it when
I was up in Oxford competing for a scholarship at Trinity
or Balliol, lodging with Ray, who was afterwards to be my
scout, in one of the sixteenth-century cottages which now
form part of Trinity.</p>

<p class='c016'>In Australia the only money I made in journalism was
five pounds which I received from the <i>Queenslander</i> for the
serial rights of a novel which I have never re-published,
and a guinea which I received from the <i>Illustrated Australian
News</i> as a prize for the best poem on Federation.</p>

<p class='c016'>When I got back to England, the first paid journalism
I did was for the <i>Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News</i>,
edited by A. E. T. Watson, who now edits the <i>Badminton
Magazine</i>, and who projected and edits the <i>Badminton Library</i>,
and is a member of the National Hunt Committee—one
of the chief sportsmen in journalism. The subjects on
which I wrote were Australian cricket and Australian poetry,
like Gordon’s, and on both subjects I was the chief authority
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>until I went to America, odd as it may seem now. I also
wrote on Gordon for the <i>Graphic</i>, and had a long historical
article in the <i>Cornhill</i>, and a serial novel—<i>Trincolox</i>—in
<i>Temple Bar</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>When I went to America, I wrote a good deal for papers
and magazines, but almost entirely in verse, except a series
of articles which I had to telegraph from Montreal about
the Carnival to a great American daily. I remember thinking
that the telegraphing was such a useless expense for such
unimportant stuff.</p>

<p class='c016'>In Japan I wrote a good deal for the <i>Japan Gazette</i>, but
my contributions were gratis, because there the editor,
Nuttall, now one of the editors of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, was
expected to write the whole paper himself. I used to help
him, and he exerted himself to get various permissions for
me. He was a very capable man, who kept his paper
interesting though he had to make his bricks without straw.</p>

<p class='c016'>However, when I got back to America from Japan I
commenced journalism in real earnest. I wrote a good many
articles at four pounds a column for the <i>San Francisco
Chronicle</i>, and, as I have said, wrote for many papers in
New York, and when I returned to England I introduced
the American biographical journalism to many papers, and
at one time was fully occupied with it, until I diverted the
capabilities I used for it to the founding of <i>Who’s Who</i>.</p>

</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>My</span> active literary career dates from my return from
America. Hitherto, with the exception of the <i>Handbook
to Japan</i> and the potboiler for the North German Lloyd, and
a shilling shocker, published anonymously, and the two
series of articles on Japan executed for the <i>San Francisco
Chronicle</i> and McClure’s Syndicate respectively, my literary
aspirations had all been poetical. I had published volumes
of my own verse entitled: <i>Frithjof and Ingebjorg</i>, <i>Australian
Lyrics</i>, <i>A Poetry of Exiles</i>, <i>A Summer Christmas</i>, <i>In Cornwall
and Across the Sea</i>, <i>Edward the Black Prince</i>, <i>The Spanish
Armada</i>, <i>Lester the Loyalist</i>, and four anthologies, <i>Australian
Ballads and Rhymes</i>, <i>A Century of Australian Song</i>, <i>Australian
Poets and Younger American Poets</i>, one of which,
<i>Australian Ballads</i>, had a very large sale, though I only had
ten pounds for doing it.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>But in America I had been under the necessity of making
money, because my private income was unequal to the
increased expense of living in America. The articles for
McClure and the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> were the outcome
of this necessity, and having found that I could add materially
to my income by writing about travel when in America, I
conceived the idea of making my articles on Japan, a country
then but little known in England, into a book. I went to
Mr. A. P. Watt, then not many years established, and he
procured me a commission from Hutchinson &amp; Co.—the
first of a series of commissions which has gone on from that
day to this. That book was <i>The Japs at Home</i>, the most
successful, in point of sales, of all my books, for not less
than a hundred and fifty thousand copies of it have been
sold by various publishers. Hutchinson &amp; Co. brought out
editions of it at eighteen shillings (two), six shillings, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>three-and-six, and then, having got through four editions of
it, and believing the sale at an end, gave the book up to me.
Another publisher sold fifteen thousand copies of it at half-a-crown,
and then exchanged the book rights with me for
the serial rights, and since then there has been a shilling
edition, an enormous sixpenny edition, and a threepenny-halfpenny
edition; the shilling and the threepenny-halfpenny
editions are selling still.</p>

<p class='c016'>Following <i>The Japs at Home</i> came <i>On the Cars and Off</i>,
the success of which was ruined by having illustrations which
took six weeks to produce. It was a guinea book, and a
first edition of a thousand copies was sold directly. But the
second edition was not ready till nearly two months later,
and by that time the interest in the book was dead.</p>

<p class='c016'>My next book of travel was <i>Brittany for Britons</i>, published
as one of the familiar little half-crown guides of A. and C.
Black, of which a great number of copies were sold. I cannot
say how many, because I parted with the copyright.</p>

<p class='c016'>After this my energies were diverted from travel-books
for a while, because I wanted to try my hand at novel-writing.
The result was <i>A Japanese Marriage</i>, which, after <i>The Japs
at Home</i>, has been my most successful book in sales. About
ten thousand copies of it were sold in octavo form, and as a
sixpenny various publishers have sold a hundred and twenty
thousand.</p>

<p class='c016'>For two years after our return from America we confined
ourselves to short excursions to the milder parts of England—Hampshire,
chiefly round Norman Christchurch; Devonshire,
in the nook of Dartmoor round Drewsteignton, and on
the gloriously wild coast round Salcombe; and the woods of
the Isle of Wight. During this period I finished <i>The Japs
at Home</i>, and wrote <i>On the Cars and Off</i>, which was not
published till 1895, about our double journey across America
from Halifax to Vancouver’s Island.</p>

<p class='c016'>Then a new interest came into my life—we were persuaded
in 1895 to spend a summer and autumn at St. Andrews, and
there I acquired the inevitable taste for golf, which has kept
me interested and amused and healthful and unaging. Certainly
this was one of the most fortunate inspirations we ever
had for a holiday, since, after being devoted to games at school
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>and College and in Australia, I had left off football and cricket
and tennis, and even shooting, as soon as I settled in London.</p>

<p class='c016'>Poor old Tom Morris never had a worse pupil, for I play
everything wrong, and owe the prizes and medals I have
won at golf to the straightness of eye which helped me to
win every shooting challenge cup at Cheltenham and every
shooting challenge cup at Oxford. At St. Andrews I not
only had a glorious spell of golf, but fell deeply in love with
romantic and historical Fifeshire. There are few places
which combine so many attractions as St. Andrews. It is
the capital of golf; its cliffs capped with old houses, and its
ancient port, are beautiful enough for Sicily, and its great
ruined castle and its immemorial cathedral make it architecturally
the most interesting place in Scotland after Edinburgh
and Stirling. Nor does it yield to many in historical
interest. I should live there if it had a climate like Naples.</p>

<p class='c016'>It gave us such a hunger for old architecture and romantic
scenery that in the following summer we went to the old
Breton towns on the Gulf of St. Malo. We stayed at St.
Servan in a seventeenth-century <i>manoir</i> called La Gentillerie,
which we had from the chaplain, my school-friend, William
Vassall, who stayed with us as our guest in his own house.</p>

<p class='c016'>From a point close by we could look across the harbour
to St. Malo, with its mediæval walls and crane’s-bill steeple,
and on the other side were no further from Dinan. From
St. Servan we went on for a month in Normandy, which I
much prefer to Brittany. Towns like Rouen and Caen,
Coutances and Bayeux, Evreux, Lisieux and Falaise, are
citadels of mediævalism.</p>

<p class='c016'>During this holiday I wrote my third travel-book, published
in England, <i>Brittany for Britons</i>, issued a year later, and put
the final touches on my first acknowledged novel, <i>A Japanese
Marriage</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>It was my two books on Japan, <i>The Japs at Home</i> and
<i>A Japanese Marriage</i>, which helped me to gain a literary
position; both went into several editions in their first year.
Between them they have sold more than a quarter of a
million copies.</p>

<p class='c016'>But I was on the verge of a book-success of another kind,
which could hardly be called a literary success, though more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>people connect my name with this than with any of my
books. Messrs. A. &amp; C. Black, who had published <i>A
Japanese Marriage</i> and <i>Brittany for Britons</i>, approached me
to know if I would expand <i>Who’s Who</i>, of which they had
just purchased the copyright.</p>

<p class='c016'>They showed it to me, and asked me if I could turn it
into a book of reference—a sort of cross between the old
<i>Who’s Who</i> and <i>Men of the Time</i> was the idea which shaped
itself from our discussion.</p>

<p class='c016'>The two visits which we paid to Salcombe in Devon, the
second of them with Reginald Cleaver, have not yet furnished
me with any subject for writing.</p>

<p class='c016'>The year 1896, in which I compiled the new <i>Who’s Who</i>,
was also a notable year for me from the travel point of view.
At last I faced the exertion of taking my family to Sicily,
which had been my ambition for exactly ten years. It was
not such a stereotyped journey as it is now. I began to
make inquiries about it when we reached Naples, and could
not find an Englishman in the place—even the Consul-General—who
had ever been to Sicily. But the Consul-General
made inquiries, and said that he did not think
travelling in Sicily was very difficult or dangerous. He,
however, asked me if I had a revolver, and recommended
me not to take out a licence for it at the Consulate, because
in Sicily a licence is not available for the whole island, but
only for one province, and there are seven provinces. He
also told me that he was quite sure that no Sicilian ever
took out a licence, though they all carried firearms. As for
malaria, he did not know; he never troubled about it; he
always spent the summer in or near Naples, and never felt
any the worse for it. This Consul was my great friend,
Eustace Neville-Rolfe, who had lately sold his ancestral
estate of Heacham in Norfolk. Nelson students will remember
allusions in the great Admiral’s letters to his uncle Rolfe
at Heacham. But my friend hated the climate of Norfolk,
and hated its politics, and settled at Naples, where a good
many years afterwards they made him Consul-General for
the unconstitutional reason that he knew more about Naples
than any living Englishman. He had the unique distinction
of joining the Consular Service as a Consul-General.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>When we got to Sicily we found it perfectly easy and safe.
The Whitakers of Palermo, to whom he gave us an introduction,
at once became our friends, and told us all we ought
to see and all we ought to do in the island. On that trip
we paid fairly exhaustive visits to Palermo, Taormina,
Syracuse, Girgenti, Marsala, Trapani, Selinunte, and Segesta,
and flying visits to Catania and Messina.</p>

<p class='c016'>Sicily is an adorable country. Grass, flowers and fruit-trees
grow right down to the edge of the sea, where there
is any soil, for half the island is rock. There are no brigands
on the sea-coasts, and nearly every monument worth visiting
is in sight of the sea. There is not a place in the island from
which you cannot see a mountain. It is the land of the
orange and the lemon; and possesses the rare charm of
ancient Greek and mediæval Arab architecture.</p>

<p class='c016'>Sicily inspired me to write the largest of all my books,
<i>In Sicily</i>, and inspired a publisher to produce it in an <i>édition
de luxe</i>, whose two volumes weighed fourteen pounds, and
contained four hundred illustrations. I called it <i>In Sicily</i>
because it was not until several years afterwards that I
considered that I knew enough about the island to write a
book with the more pretentious title of <i>Sicily</i>. A great
French author paid me the compliment of appropriating my
title, and a good deal of my information, a few years afterwards.
I began to write <i>In Sicily</i> in 1896, but it was not
published till 1901.</p>

<p class='c016'>We spent the spring of 1896 in Sicily, and the summer at
Lulworth, on a little round cove in South Dorset. We went
there partly because it was said to be the mildest place in
England, partly because Thomas Hardy told me that he had
laid the scene of one of the chief episodes in <i>Tess of the D’Urbervilles</i>
in an old farmhouse near the station which served
Lulworth; it had a hopelessly unromantic name—Wool.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the following summer we went to Ostend for the season,
because I wanted to see the gambling and the fashions. The
morals of the Ostend of that day may be gathered from
this. A friend of mine who was staying at the principal hotel
with her husband, was asked by the proprietor if they were
properly married. She was most indignant, and said that
of course they were.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>“Very well,” he said coolly, “then I think you ought to
go to some other hotel, because you are the only people in
mine who have been married.”</p>

<p class='c016'>That same hotel manager considered that things were no
longer what they were, for an Indian Maharajah had that
morning complained at being charged two pounds for a
chicken—that the English and Americans were no longer
fools, and, in fact, that the only fools left were the Austrians.</p>

<p class='c016'>The late King of the Belgians was in residence at the
chateau, and had not one, but three, notorious French
actresses staying with him.</p>

<p class='c016'>Apart from its <i>plage</i> and its gaming-tables, I should have
found Ostend a dull place if it had not been for Henry Arthur
Jones, who was there, off and on, writing a new play, and
ready to discuss it. He had had a play at the St. James’s
which had not gone too well, and he asked me if I could account
for it. I suggested that allowing a hospital nurse to frustrate
an elopement was more calculated to gratify the gallery than
the stalls, and that the St. James’s was a stalls theatre.</p>

<p class='c016'>Jones had one curious habit—whenever he felt at a standstill
in writing his play he used to say he must have a change
of air, and then fly away to Homburg or some other place
which took many hours to reach. He was much interested
in gambling, though he did not gamble seriously. I imagine
that he found the gaming-tables full of “copy.”</p>

<p class='c016'>In the winter we went to Sicily again, and in the summer
to Salcombe again.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the following winter my connection with <i>Who’s Who</i>
ceased. My agreement with the publishers was only for three
years in case the book was a failure, and the publishers
pronounced it a failure.</p>

<p class='c016'>Almost immediately afterwards I had an attack of jaundice,
brought on, or not brought on, by the incident, and after a
short stay at Brighton, went to recruit my health at Nice,
from which I paid many visits to Monte Carlo, though I did
not gamble much.</p>

<p class='c016'>On our way back from Nice we did what not one Englishman
in a hundred, among the thousands who winter in the
Riviera, does, got off at Tarascon, and wandered about the
cities of Troubadour-land, such as Tarascon, Arles, Nîmes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>Avignon and Les Baux, the deserted capital of a dead
principality, where the houses, instead of being built, are
hewn out of the face of the rock. Provence is full of ancient
Roman buildings, and of Romanesque buildings, hardly to
be distinguished from them; and, in our day, in spite of the
law against it, they used the Roman amphitheatres for the
modern equivalent of gladiatorial games—bull-fights. Bull-fighting
always began on Easter Sunday.</p>

<p class='c016'>I registered a resolve, which I have never kept, to write
a book about Provence.</p>

<p class='c016'>That summer we spent at Cookham on the Thames.
Since we were unable to go abroad, we went on the river,
as being the most frankly “Continental” place in England.
We had perfect weather, and Ostend itself did not give us
more pleasure than the reach of the river between Cookham
and Maidenhead. I found lying in a punt outside the lock
at the Cliveden end conducive for finding incidents for fiction.</p>

<p class='c016'>And I had not done sufficient creative work since I began
<i>Who’s Who</i>. Indeed, <i>The Admiral</i>, my novel of the love of
Nelson and Lady Hamilton, which I finished at Ostend, had
been nearly my whole output, for <i>Trincolox</i> had been written
ten years before, and published in <i>Temple Bar</i>. I was, of
course, working at the materials for <i>In Sicily</i> all the time,
and in the spring of 1900 we paid another three months’
visit to Sicily to see that all my facts were up to date.</p>

<p class='c016'>We were at Syracuse during the darkest days of the Boer
War. About half the people in the house were Germans,
who were openly pleased at the succession of disasters
which had befallen the British arms before they could get
proper forces out to South Africa, to fight an enemy who
was prepared in every single detail before he forced on the
war. It seemed as if the disasters never would stop, and
these amiable people told us so every day. But one fine
day a British battleship, one of the largest then afloat, steamed
into the great harbour of Syracuse, and anchored in the
waters where the Athenians were annihilated in their last
sea-fight against the Syracusans. We were down on the
quay, and so was nearly every other foreigner in Syracuse,
when a launch put off from H.M.S., and made towards us.
The Captain, a typical sea-dog—it was Callaghan, now one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>of our chief Admirals—was in the stern. As he stepped
ashore he said: “We have just had a wireless from Malta—Kimberley
is relieved.” It was most dramatic to have the
news brought to us by the biggest battleship in the Mediterranean,
how French had introduced a new feature into warfare
by raising a siege with a dash of five thousand cavalry riding
all day as hard as they could. I shall never forget it.</p>

<p class='c016'>We returned to Rome in time for the Papal Jubilee, the
sixth centenary of the original Jubilee established by Boniface
VIII in 1300. Some of the ceremonies were extraordinarily
interesting, and the procession of Leo XIII in St. Peter’s
was one of the most impressive things I ever saw. I think
it was that which inspired me to write <i>The Secrets of the
Vatican</i>, though I did not complete it for publication till
nearly seven years afterwards.</p>

<p class='c016'>That summer again we went to Cookham, which had
serious results, for my son was thrown into contact with
some charming boys who had just passed into the Army,
and were spending their vacation from Woolwich at Bourne
End, a mile up the river from Cookham. Nothing would do
for him after this but to go into the Army. I did not oppose
it, because he was an absolutely idle boy at school, and it
seemed such a good thing that he should want to pass any
exam., and further, I was almost as much under the glamour
of those dear boys—poor St. John Spackman, who was
afterwards killed in the polo-field, was one of them—as he was.</p>

<p class='c016'>That inspired me to write <i>My Son Richard</i>, which is a
story of river life and boys who want to serve their country.
I took him to Captain James, the leading Army crammer, and
said that he wanted to get into the Army. In a few home
questions, James discovered that he had never done any
work at school, and said he had better go into the Artillery—he
could not get into the Line. I looked incredulous, and
he explained that in the Artillery exams. there are papers
in more subjects which boys do not learn at school, so that
a boy who has not done any work has not lost time over
this—such things, for instance, as “fortification” and
“military topography.”</p>

<p class='c016'>My son amply fulfilled his prognostications by securing
ninety per cent. of the marks in the military subjects, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>only sixteen marks out of two thousand in Latin. Still, he
passed, but, to his great disappointment, was not allowed to go
out to the war which had just begun, because he was too young.</p>

<p class='c016'>In this year, 1901, in which both my big book <i>In Sicily</i>
and my novel <i>My Son Richard</i>, first saw the light, I
had plenty to do, for I was finishing and attending to the
publication of <i>Queer Things about Japan</i>, which was the
best received of all my books of travel. It owed its success
largely to the timely moment at which I wrote it. Knowing
Japan well, I was convinced that there was going to be a
Russo-Japanese war, and Sidney Dark, the brilliant literary
editor of the <i>Daily Express</i>, as alive a journalist and critic as
there is in London, was at that time manager of the firm
of publishers to whom I offered the book, because they had
recently taken over the publication of the sixpenny edition
of <i>A Japanese Marriage</i>. It was not hard to convince him
that there was war in the air for Japan, and he commissioned
the book with the happiest results. Much of it appeared
serially in the papers connected with the Tillotson Syndicate,
which at that time had Philip Gibbs for its editor. He
accepted my offer to write him eight long instalments about
Japan for the Syndicate. Just as I had finished and dispatched
them, he wrote to tell me that he did not think
that Japan was a sufficiently live subject, and asked me
not to write the articles.</p>

<p class='c016'>No sooner had he written the letter than he received the
articles. He read them and thought them so good that he
sent me a telegram cancelling his letter, and used them.
They form the backbone of the book. He had asked me to
be as humorous as possible. Other editors thought them
very amusing, and when the approach of war made Japan
the topic of the day, showered commissions on me.</p>

<p class='c016'>Norma Lorimer, who was all through Japan with us, was
of great assistance to me in recalling our life there, and I
got her a good many commissions for articles, which were
afterwards collected with some of the articles that I wrote
during the war into <i>More Queer Things about Japan</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>In this same year, 1901, Hutchinson &amp; Co. published
<i>My Son Richard</i>, which, as I have said above, was a novel
about boys who had just passed into the Army, and girls of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>the same age, spending the summer on the river at Cookham.
As an instance of rapid printing, I may mention that
Hutchinson got me all the proofs of this book in seven days,
but he recently, in 1913, eclipsed this by making the printer
give me all the proofs of <i>Weeds</i> in six days.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>My Son Richard</i> was very popular. A Duchess wrote to a
newspaper which was collecting statistics about the popularity
of books, that this was the nicest book she had ever read,
and when it came out as a sixpenny, the village grocer at
Cookham ordered hundreds and told me that every maidservant
for miles round was buying it. I wish they would
buy all my other sixpennies. To reach the servant class is
a most difficult achievement.</p>

<p class='c016'>As Miss Lorimer had broken her leg that year and still
could not move about much, we went for August to
Baveno on Lago Maggiore, to an hotel with a garden on
the lake, where she had a room looking right over the
exquisite Borromean Islands, Isola Bella and Isola dei
Pescatori. Italy has always been her favourite subject for
writing. She corrected the proofs of her <i>By the Waters of
Sicily</i> here, which is as popular as ever, though it has been
out for twelve years.</p>

<p class='c016'>Baveno had the happiest effect on her. The air is lovely,
and her window looked right over the finest sweep of Lago
Maggiore, with the islands in front and the snow-tipped
Alps behind. Heavy square-prowed barges with junk sails
used to glide slowly across the eye-line, and light high-prowed
fishing-boats with hoods like Japanese sampans
darted about near the shore, which had long pergolas overhanging
the lake and Passion-vines sweeping over every shed.</p>

<p class='c016'>A month’s rest at Baveno made her leg quite well, and
then we were able to spend a fascinating September in the
mountain city of Bergamo; Brescia, with its history and
monuments of a thousand years; and Venice, which is always
most adorable in summer. The Feast of the Redentore in
July is the crown of the year at Venice. We had learnt, and
we have often made use of our knowledge since, that Italy
is at her best in summer.</p>

<p class='c016'>I do not seem to have published any books in 1902 or
1903, though I was writing steadily all the time, and had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>a couple of serials running in a magazine, but I was collecting
materials hard for the biggest piece of work I have ever
accomplished. Those who take up <i>Sicily, the New Winter
Resort</i>, a small octavo, and <i>In Sicily</i>, two immense quartos,
will be surprised to hear that the smaller book contains a
far greater amount of reading matter than the larger—half
as much again, I should say—though the one costs five
shillings net and the other three guineas. The Directors of
the Rete Sicula, for whom I compiled the smaller book,
stipulated that it was to be cheap in price and handy in
form. This book is an encyclopædia of Sicily. It itemises
every monument of any importance, every custom, every
piece of scenery noted for its beauty, every railway station,
and gives information about every name which comes
prominently into the history or the mythology of the island.
It also gives directions how every monument and beautiful
piece of scenery is to be reached.</p>

<p class='c016'>Nineteen hundred and two was the last summer which
we spent at Cookham. My son was then at Woolwich, and
we stayed at Cookham so that he could have his week-ends
on the river. That winter and spring we again spent in
Sicily and Italy. But that summer we spent at Tenby for
the first time, because my son had now been gazetted to a
Company of Artillery which was stationed at Pembroke Dock.
Tenby I consider one of the most beautiful coast-places in the
United Kingdom. It stands on a rock over the sea, and still
retains a considerable portion of walls and towers built in the
reign of the third Edward, and restored during the Spanish
Armada scare in 1588. It has also a magnificent Gothic
church, and one Gothic house. Its position is hard to beat,
for its rock stands between two splendid stretches of sand,
and when the wind blows on one side you are out of the wind
on the other. On the north sands is a green bluff. If you
walk inland it is easy to find deep woods, and if you walk
across the golf-links (there is very good natural golf) you come
on to noble downs with gorgeous precipices sheering down to
the sea, and rich in the ruins of historic and prehistoric
men—literally historic, for there is Geoffry of Monmouth’s
castle of Manorbier, and far beyond, my ancestor Aylmer
de Valence’s castle of Pembroke, which, like the castle of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>the Carews, rises out of the windings of the great haven of
the West.</p>

<p class='c016'>Such is Tenby, round which, under the name of Flanders,
I built a romance in my novel, <i>The Unholy Estate</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>The golf-links served both Tenby and the naval and
military officers at Pembroke Dock. Nearly every day I
used to meet the Gunner and Infantry subalterns and captains
disporting themselves on the links, and I was often over at
Pembroke in the barracks. It was there that I picked up
my knowledge of young soldiers, which I put into use in
<i>The Unholy Estate</i>, <i>The Tragedy of the Pyramids</i> and <i>The
Curse of the Nile</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>The winter we generally spent in Italy, except the winter
and spring of 1906, when we were once more in Sicily, and
went across from Sicily to visit Tunis and Carthage.</p>

<p class='c016'>In 1904 I was busy putting the finishing touches on two
books about Japan, <i>More Queer Things about Japan</i>, the
book in which I collaborated with Norma Lorimer, and
<i>Playing the Game</i>, which in the cheap editions has had its
name changed to <i>When We Were Lovers in Japan</i>. This
book has been running serially in <i>Cassell’s Magazine</i>. It
never had half the popularity or circulation of <i>A Japanese
Marriage</i>, though it had much more value as a study of
Japan and the Japanese, for it deals with the transition of
Japan from a weak Oriental nation to one of the great
powers of the world, and gives an acid picture of the futility of
the diplomats to whom Great Britain entrusts her interests.</p>

<p class='c016'>In this same year, 1904, Methuen brought out <i>Sicily, the
New Winter Resort</i>. In 1905 I turned my attention to Sicily
once more, working up the serial which had appeared in
<i>Cassell’s Magazine</i> into the volume which the publishers
insisted on christening <i>A Sicilian Marriage</i>, to try and lend
it some of the popularity of <i>A Japanese Marriage</i>, which it
never acquired, and the world never discovered that it was
an excellent popular guide-book to Palermo, Girgenti, Syracuse
and Taormina.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the same year I brought out <i>Queer Things about Sicily</i>,
a companion volume to <i>Queer Things about Japan</i>, with
Norma Lorimer.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XVII<br /> <br /><span class='c022'>THE WRITING OF MY BOOKS: PART II</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>In</span> 1906 I was busy writing two books into which a good
deal of history came, <i>Carthage and Tunis, the Old and New
Gates of the Orient</i>, and <i>The Secrets of the Vatican</i>, the former
of which I published at the end of that year, and the latter
at the beginning of the following year.</p>

<p class='c016'>We were hovering between Italy in the winter, and Tenby
in the summer, and taking uncommonly little out of our rent
at 32 Addison Mansions.</p>

<p class='c016'>I had always been mightily interested in Carthage. I
hated Carthage being beaten by Rome, partly, perhaps,
because history has invested the career of Hannibal and the
fall of Carthage with such undying romance. When we
were in Sicily in 1906 we suddenly made up our minds to go
to Tunis, of which Carthage is practically a suburb, just
as when we were at Vancouver we suddenly made up our
minds to take a trip to Japan.</p>

<p class='c016'>Carthage is disappointing to those who wish to see Punic
remains. Of the mighty walls described by Polybius, there
remains hardly one stone upon another. Its impregnable
naval harbour and arsenal have dried up into mere ponds—in
fact, there is nothing Punic about it, except subterranean
tombs, which you can only reach by being lowered in a
basket, and the gorgeous coffins and ornaments which came
out of them, and are preserved in the museum of the White
Fathers.</p>

<p class='c016'>But of Roman Carthage there are plenty of remains—an
amphitheatre, and a theatre, and mighty underground cisterns,
and the foundations of immense churches. In that
amphitheatre a most interesting lot of saints were martyred,
St. Perpetua herself among them.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>No ruins have been discovered connected with the career
of St. Augustine, the Carthaginian to whom the White
Fathers attach so much more importance than to Hannibal
or Hamilcar; and all memories of Dido have hopelessly
disappeared. Any remains that there might have been of
the citadel so desperately defended against Scipio, have
been obliterated by the erection of a cathedral on the site,
the consummation of the life-work of Cardinal Lavigerie.
That there is not one human being for a congregation, except
the White Fathers in the monastery, does not appear to
signify at all. The cathedral is there, just on the spot where
you want to forget it most, and think of the tremendous
human tragedy to which that hill is sacred.</p>

<p class='c016'>I loved wandering about the site of Carthage, ruminating
upon history; I found the study of the saints of Carthage
fascinating, and gave a good deal of my book to them when
I came to write about Carthage, in which I also gave translations
of the very extensive passages which Virgil devotes
to it, without apparently having possessed any antiquarian
knowledge at all upon the subject.</p>

<p class='c016'>History is very ironical here. You sometimes meet
wandering, or encamped about the site of Carthage, Berbers,
lineal descendants of the aborigines dispossessed by Dido
and her Phœnicians when they founded Carthage, who lasted
as a race to see Phœnician Carthage perish, and the Christian
and Roman Carthage, which rose upon its ashes, perish
likewise before the invading Arabs, and the Arabs, after
temporary subjugation by this or the other invader, finally
conquered by the French. Their language, too, has survived,
though it was in danger of extinction till French scholars
made its preservation and study a hobby.</p>

<p class='c016'>It must not be forgotten that when Carthage came to life
again she had her revenge on Rome, for the Vandal King
of Carthage captured Rome, and carries its empress in chains
to Carthage, with the Table of the Shewbread, the Ark of
the Covenant, and the Seven-branched Candlestick captured
by Titus—trophies to which the Romans had ever since
attached superstitious importance.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the last half of 1906 and the spring of 1907 I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>unusually busy. We spent the summer for the fourth year in
succession at Tenby. Eustache de Lorey was there with me
collaborating in <i>Queer Things about Persia</i>. I planned the
outline of the book; I suggested subjects for the chapters;
I extracted some of them by cross-examination; I wrote
down others when he was in an anecdotal vein. And some
he wrote in French, and we translated them together. Had
he been able to accumulate a book in English unaided, there
was no reason why he should not have written it all himself.
His careful, slightly foreign English was very effective. But
I may take this credit to myself, that the book would never
have been conceived without me, and even had it been conceived,
it would neither have been begun, nor, having been
begun, would it have been finished, without my professional
industry. I enjoyed writing it very much indeed. De Lorey
was such a delightful companion, and I learnt so much about
Persia by writing a book on it. This sounds like a paradox,
but it is a universal truth.</p>

<p class='c016'>Simultaneously I was engaged on finishing my own book
on Carthage and Tunis. In this book I had to rely almost
entirely on French materials, because the two main sources
of information are the official publications of the French
authorities, and commercial firms interested in the exploitation
of Tunis, and the publications of the White Fathers out
at Carthage, about its site and its remains.</p>

<p class='c016'>I was also finishing a book upon which I had been at work
for some years—<i>The Secrets of the Vatican</i>, in which I enjoyed
the assistance of his Eminence the Cardinal-Archbishop of
Westminster, in the chapter which dealt with the Church
crisis in France.</p>

<p class='c016'>When I went to ask him to help me, he asked me what I
was going to call my book. I replied, <i>The Secrets of the
Vatican</i>. He said, “Doesn’t it sound rather——”—instead
of giving me the word, he gave a sniff. I shall never forget
that sniff—it expressed the whole situation. I hastened to
explain that the Secrets were all archæological secrets, and
he handed me the materials for my chapter.</p>

<p class='c016'>Some time before this, he had asked our mutual friend,
Cortesi, Reuter’s agent at Rome, to tell me a story of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>Pope, in connection with my <i>Sicily, the New Winter Resort</i>.
Cardinal Bourne had taken a tour in Sicily, using my <i>Sicily</i>
as his guide. When he got back to Rome, he showed an
anecdote in the book to the Pope. The anecdote was about
Cardinal Newman, who had told me an extraordinary experience
he had had in Sicily. It was at Castrogiovanni, where
he lay for some weeks between life and death, suffering from
a fever, which was the result of his being totally robbed of
sleep by fleas when he was making a tour round Etna. The
greatest affliction with which he had to contend was the
incessant ringing of church bells—Castrogiovanni, the Enna
of Ceres and Proserpine, has more churches for its size
than any city in Sicily. Poor Newman’s only chance of
sleep, which meant life to him, was to keep his head under
the bedclothes in that semi-tropical climate. The inhabitants
went about aghast, saying that he had a devil. The
Pope thought the idea of the future Prince of the
Church (Protestant though he was then) having a devil,
was ludicrously funny, and laughed till his sides ached,
like an ordinary man. When Newman did recover from
the fever, and was on his way from Sicily to Sardinia in
a fruit boat, he wrote his famous hymn, “Lead, kindly
light.”</p>

<p class='c016'><i>The Secrets of the Vatican</i> formed one half of a book which
I began as a commission from Eveleigh Nash some years
before. The numerous changes in non-papal Rome, and the
important excavations of its pagan monuments, which were
announced, but postponed and postponed, made me despair
of ever getting the book finished, and finally I decided to
publish the part which related to the Vatican in a volume
by itself. This, after going through three editions, has
been, for further publication, divided into two parts. The
personal matter about the present Pope, and the information
about the ceremonies which relate to the election, coronation,
death and burial of a Pope, and about the composition of
his court, are still published by Hurst &amp; Blackett, with
certain additional information on the subject, under the
title of <i>The Pope at Home</i>, while the part which relates to
the history, architecture and collections of the Vatican, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>now published by Kegan Paul, Trench &amp; Co., under the
title of <i>How to See the Vatican</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>The Secrets of the Vatican</i> was published in 1907, a few
months before we began our memorable expedition to Egypt,
which has played such an important part in my writings
ever since.</p>

<p class='c016'>Having to study economy in our travels, we determined
to break the journey to Egypt in Italy, and with that idea
went to Lake Como in the last days of July 1907.</p>

<p class='c016'>Anything more beautiful than Lago di Como in August it
is difficult to conceive. All the way up its west side the lake
is fringed with crimson oleanders in full blossom. Though
the days are cloudless, and the nights encrusted with stars,
by perfect summer weather, there are no mosquitoes. It is
a land of peaches, and of old villas with gardens, which look
as if they had come down from the ancient Romans, with
their vases and pavilions and terraces and broad flights of
steps leading down into the clear water of the lake—this is
the lake from Arconati to Cadenabbia.</p>

<p class='c016'>Here we spent a month under the acacia and tulip trees,
revelling in fruit and flowers, before we went south to Como
City; and east to Sermione, in the reedy shallows of Lago
di Garda, dominated by the castle of the Scaligers, which
loses not one ray of sunshine from sunrise to sunset; to
storied Mantua in its marches; to Verona, half ancient Roman,
half Gothic, and wholly romantic, and to Venice the matchless.</p>

<p class='c016'>Venice is a stone city conjured up from the sea. In the
city proper there is no more earth than you might have in
roof-gardens. There are no horses, no motors. You seem
to be living on the roof of the sea. The palaces, which rise
from the water in such unending succession, were mostly
built in the Middle Ages, when Venice had the sea-trade of
the world. The finest of them line the Grand Canal from
side to side for a mile from its mouth, and at its mouth are
the most beautiful buildings in Europe, which have been
standing there three and four and five hundred years at the
head of the stately flight of steps where the world once
came to the feet of Venice—St. Mark’s, the Doge’s Palace,
and the Library, surrounding that Piazetta of smooth white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>flagstones. You feel that they are too beautiful to be true,
that they must be the airy fabric of a vision, which will
presently pass away, and leave not a wrack behind.</p>

<p class='c016'>I never go to Venice without wondering why I can live
away from it. Yet I have never published my tribute to it,
except in periodicals, and in the pages about it which come
into my <i>How to See Italy</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>I have to say the same of Florence, to which we moved
from Venice on our progress through Italy to Egypt. Like
Venice, I have visited it many times, and I find Florence
one of the most inspiring cities in the world. The Venetian,
unless he be a guide or a gondolier, is silent to foreigners;
he takes no account of them; there are few foreigners living
in Venice. But in Florence there are five thousand foreigners,
who talk about the glories of Florence every day, and all the
inhabitants seem to be children of the Medici Florence, who
think that every foreigner’s mind should be in the Florence
of the Middle Ages. You talk pictures or history all day
long.</p>

<p class='c016'>From Florence we went on to Rome and Naples, where
we were to take ship for Egypt. Of Rome I have written
much in <i>How to See Italy</i>, as well as in <i>The Secrets of the
Vatican</i>, which contained the fruit of years of study. I have
also published in periodicals enough to fill another book
about the parts which belong to the kingdom of Italy, as
the Vatican belongs to the Papacy. To Rome I go back
regularly. About Rome I intend to publish a book like
<i>How to See Italy</i>, and <i>Sicily, the New Winter Resort</i>, combined,
to make use of my street by street study of the Eternal
City. I know Rome far better than London. Rome has
always appealed to my historical enthusiasm, in the one
point where Florence leaves me cold, for Florence was, as
it were, at the back of the door while kingdoms were being
carved out of the unformed mass of Europe during the
Middle Ages, while Rome gave the world laws, language
and civilisation, collated from the wisdom of the ancient
world.</p>

<p class='c016'>Naples itself is not an inviting town, but it slopes up from
one of the most beautiful bays in the world, and it is rich in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>outstanding objects—Capri in front, Vesuvius on the left,
the hill of Posilippo on the right, and the three great castles,
St. Elmo, del Ovo and Nuovo, which make the points of
a vast triangle from the sea to the mountain-top, while in
the centre is the rock of Parthenope, now called the Falcon’s
Peak, the site of Palæpolis, the old city, which came before
Neapolis, the new city.</p>

<p class='c016'>The outskirts of Naples are of the highest interest, for on
the south side the disinterred ruins of Pompeii and Herculanæum
lie under their destroyer, Vesuvius, the most interesting
volcano in the world; and on the other are Cumæ,
the first settlement of the Greeks in the virgin lands of
Italy, which was their America; and all the volcanic phenomena,
which furnished Roman mythology with the details
of its Hades.</p>

<p class='c016'>Pompeii is of undying interest to me, especially since the
new custom has come in of leaving any fresh treasures which
are discovered, <i>in situ</i>. There is no place where, if you study
it in conjunction with the collections in the museum of Naples,
you can so easily picture the life of the Greeks and Romans
as at Pompeii. I have many times thought of writing upon
Pompeii.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /> <br /><span class='c022'>THE WRITING OF MY BOOKS: PART III</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>It</span> was Benton Fletcher, one of the “identities” of Egypt,
equally well known as an artist who does valuable work in
connection with excavations and does delightful landscapes,
which are the fashion with “winterers” in Egypt, who first
put into my head the idea of visiting that matchless country.
Egypt is literally matchless; there is no country in the world
which has such a winter climate, and no country in the world
which has monuments so ancient and so perfect, so close
together and so accessible. Every monument which is not
in an oasis is on the Nile, and the Nile in Egypt is like a
railway in other countries.</p>

<p class='c016'>Fletcher not only worked up my enthusiasm to the point
of going there, but met us on our arrival in Cairo, and initiated
me in the secret beauties of the Arab city. But for him
<i>Oriental Cairo</i> would never have been written.</p>

<p class='c016'>I was also much influenced by the photographs published
by Leo Weinthal in <i>The African World</i> and <i>Fascinating
Egypt</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>We sailed from Naples to Alexandria in the November of
1907. We did not delay an hour there, but took the next
train to Cairo.</p>

<p class='c016'>At Alexandria Egypt is Roman, and the monuments which
have yet been excavated are not, with the exception of one
marvellous late tomb, very interesting. But Alexandria
is an unexcavated Pompeii, and when some Schliemann
among its leading merchants decides to devote his energies
and his fortune to excavating the vast mounds which still
bury Roman Alexandria, we may expect finds of astonishing
interest. In the desert, about thirty miles from Alexandria,
is the city of St. Menas, an early Christian Pompeii, where there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>has already been excavated a wonderful Basilica founded
by the Emperor Arcadius.</p>

<p class='c016'>Except for a few articles in the <i>Queen</i>, I did little writing
in Egypt beyond taking copious notes. But these I did
more completely than I ever had done before, and as my
secretary was with us, they were typed out every evening,
and are now bound together into a sort of diary-journal of
our entire visit. To make them more complete as journals,
I took eight hundred photographs, and certainly bought as
many more, and as complete a collection of postcards as I
could form. Therefore I was in a very sound position for
writing my various books upon Egypt after I had returned
home. The first book I wrote upon our visit was <i>Egypt and
the English</i>, consisting partly of what we saw while we were
staying in Cairo, Alexandria, Luxor, Assuan, the Fayyum,
the Great Oasis, and while we were journeying up the Nile
to the second cataract, and down the Nile to its Rosetta and
Damietta mouths, and over the Desert Railway into the
Sudan; and partly of the result of my inquiries about the
political condition of Egypt. When the book came out,
many reviewers took up the attitude that what I said was
too alarmist, but when Mr. Roosevelt repeated it to the letter,
the Government took the warnings seriously, and appointed
the best possible man, Lord Kitchener, to take the place
of Sir Eldon Gorst, whose policy of scuttle and kowtow may
have been dictated by the Government which appointed him.</p>

<p class='c016'>I knew that my facts were sound, because I had not only
sucked as much information as I could out of British officials
and editors, and the Leader of the Egyptian Bar, but also
from the leading Syrians and Armenians, who see much more
behind the scenes than the English, because Arabic is their
business language, and the Arabs associate with them freely
in private life. Among Syrians especially I had repeated
conversations with Dr. Sarrûf and Dr. Nimr, the proprietor
and editor of <i>El Mokattan</i>, the most important Arab paper
in Egypt, to whose opinions Lord Cromer had always attached
the greatest importance, and they had told me how to meet
such of the Nationalist leaders as spoke English. These
were actual Egyptians, so <i>Egypt and the English</i> did give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>native opinion both directly from the mouths of Egyptians,
and indirectly through Syrians and Armenians.</p>

<p>HALL CAINE<br /><i>Drawn by Yoshio Markino</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c016'>I wrote <i>Egypt and the English</i> for a commission to write
<i>Queer Things about Egypt</i>. The then chairman of Hurst
&amp; Blackett, when he saw the political chapters in the
book, considered them so interesting and important that he
asked me to hold over the humorous chapters for another
book. Which I did. But in the interval he sold the business
of Hurst &amp; Blackett to my old friends Hutchinson &amp; Co.,
who published my real first success, <i>The Japs at Home</i>.
They were quite ready to take another book on Egypt from
me, and we decided to make these chapters the nucleus of
that book to be published under the original title of <i>Queer
Things about Egypt</i>. This book gives the humours of the
native city in Cairo, and the humours of travel on the Nile.
The parts of the book which attracted most attention were
those which dealt with Arab life in Cairo in the native quarters
round the Citadel, and with Arab architecture and art, so
Hutchinson asked me to do another large volume on Egypt,
devoted entirely to <i>Oriental Cairo—the City of the Arabian
Nights</i>. For that part of Cairo is almost as much an Arab
City of the Middle Ages as was Granada in the days of the
Moors, and the stories of the Arabian Nights were made into
a book by a Cairene in the sixteenth century.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Egypt and the English</i> was published in 1908, <i>Queer Things
about Egypt</i> in 1910, and <i>Oriental Cairo</i> in 1910.</p>

<p class='c016'>In 1908 I also wrote, and Hurst &amp; Blackett published,
<i>The Tragedy of the Pyramids</i>, which has been one of the most
successful of my novels. It was written as a counterblast
to Hall Caine’s <i>White Prophet</i>, which at that time was running
as a serial in the <i>Strand Magazine</i>. I considered that Caine
was giving an entirely incorrect impression of our army in
Egypt. The book is now in its ninth edition, and was an
imaginary picture of the revolution which would have overtaken
Egypt, if Sir Eldon Gorst’s scuttle and kowtow policy
had been persisted in. I had a great deal to say about the
Senussi in this book—the battle of the Pyramids was fought
against a great host of invading Senussi. The British public
had then heard little of the Senussi. But in the Turko-Italian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>war the Senussi have proved a far more dangerous
enemy to Italy than the Turks, as they are very hardy and
move with great rapidity. They are said to own many zawia,
or convents, in Egypt, and to have established a network of
wells at twenty-four hours’ distance from each other all over
the great desert of the Sahara—also to have twenty-five
thousand swift camels accumulated against any invasion of
their country, which is almost conterminous with the great
desert. Boyd Alexander, the famous explorer, is considered
to have fallen a victim to his intrusion upon their territory,
which they openly forbid to Christians, on pain of being assassinated.
But their Prophet refused to join forces in any way
with the Mahdi when he had possessed himself of the Egyptian
Sudan.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>The Tragedy of the Pyramids</i> was published in 1909, <i>Queer
Things about Egypt</i>, and <i>Oriental Cairo</i>, in 1910, the same
year which saw the publication of <i>The Moon of the Fourteenth
Night</i>, the romance which I wrote in collaboration once more
with Eustache de Lorey. As it had so much of the travel-book
about it, it was not brought out in the form of a novel. It
was, in fact, the biography of a dashing young French attaché,
who is still alive, pretty faithfully told. He had no objection
to our using it if we killed him off in the book, to throw the
girl’s relations off the track, in case they should try to kill
him in real life. The public never realised that it was actually
reading a romance of real life, that there had been such a person
as Bibi Mâh, that the escapades of Edward Valmont were not
imaginary, but episodes in a career of gallantry. The book
comes very near to being a journal of life in the Persian
capital at the beginning of the revolution.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the autumn of 1908 we went back to Italy to spend the
six cold months in Rome, hoping that we should have one
of those winters which you sometimes get in Rome, as full
of sunshine as spring—only cold when you are in the wind and
out of the sun. Yoshio Markino spent that winter with us at
12 Piazza Barberini. I got my friend Percy Spalding,
one of the directors of Chatto &amp; Windus, to give him a commission
to do the illustrations for <i>The Colour of Rome</i>, and
as I knew Rome so well, I conducted him to nearly all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>beauty-spots which furnished the subjects of his illustrations.
I showed him many others which did not appeal to him, for
Markino will not begin a picture until some <i>motif</i> in the
locality has appealed to his artistic temperament. He is an
artist to the finger-tips. His fidelity is all the more extraordinary
when you take into consideration his method of
painting a landscape.</p>

<p class='c016'>In those days he had written nothing but a short chapter
in <i>The Colour of London</i>, and <i>The Colour of Paris</i>, but he
used to show me the letters he wrote to Spalding and Ward, of
Chatto’s, about the book,—most brilliant some of them were,
and I saw that he was a born writer. I suggested to him as
early as this that he should write his life in Japan—I had not
then grasped what a story he had to tell of his life in England.</p>

<p class='c016'>He felt the cold in Rome very severely. He used to consume
quantities of the childish substitutes for fuel provided
in Roman hotels.</p>

<p class='c016'>In that first visit which he paid to Italy, he was not much
interested in the architecture or the art, just as he never
visited the Louvre while he was in Paris painting <i>The
Colour of Paris</i>. And the scenes of historical events interested
him little more, though often they played an important
part in the history of the world. He was absorbed in the
novel lines of buildings; the gay colours of Italy; the strangeness
to him of the atmospheric effects of Rome; the subtle
and ceaseless humours in the life of the Italian poor. And
their clothes delighted him, with their gay, faded colours,
their rags, and the fine abandon with which they were worn.</p>

<p class='c016'>We were in Rome collecting materials for my book on
<i>How to See Italy</i>, and I was writing the <i>Tragedy of the Pyramids</i>
mostly in bed, before I got up in the morning. Between
five and eight a.m. is a favourite time for writing with me.
I seldom begin later than 5.45; I have a cup of tea brought
to me at 6 a.m. I also wrote a good deal in periodicals about
the great earthquake at Messina. The Italian papers were
naturally full of details, which had not been telegraphed to
England, and we used to get wonderful cinema films, which
made one quite an eye-witness of the events. In Italy you
can go to the cinema for twopence.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>I was about to make a tour of the earthquake scenes in
South Italy and Sicily, and to go on to Malta, where my son
was then quartered, when I was suddenly called home by the
alarming illness of my father, who was given up by the doctors,
though he recovered and lived for nearly two years afterwards.</p>

<p class='c016'>We re-visited a few favourite spots, such as Pisa and Lucca,
on our way up, as we did not hope to see Italy again for some
time.</p>

<p class='c016'>As it chanced, it was little more than a year before we were
back in Italy again, on the most interesting tour which we
have ever spent in that country. I had a commission from
Kegan Paul, Trench &amp; Co. to write for them <i>How to See
Italy</i>, which was destined to be so popular, and there
were forty-five cities in Italy which I wished to visit or re-visit
before writing this book. I wrote it for the Italian Government,
as Kegan Paul, Trench &amp; Co. were aware, and they had
offered me many facilities. They had the blocks made for
the illustrations. I went over their entire collection of photographs
in making my choice, and where no photograph
existed, they sent their special photographer to take one.
Also they allowed me to travel about on their lines wherever
my wish took me free of charge, so I was able to wander about
Italy in a way in which the expenses would ordinarily have
been too great for any book.</p>

<p class='c016'>Markino went with us again on this journey, which lasted
from July to November. This time I had got him a commission
from Constable &amp; Co. to illustrate a book by Miss
Potter, which was published under the title of <i>A Little
Pilgrimage in Italy</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>We visited all our cities, starting from Genoa, and proceeding
to Florence, Arezzo, Cortona, Perugia, Deruta, Todi,
Siena, St. Gimignano, Passignano, Monte Oliveto, Asciano,
Chiusi, Città della Pieve, Assisi, Foligno, Spoleto, Spello,
Bevagna, Montefalco, Trevi, Clitunno, Gualdo Tadino,
Gubbio, Urbino, Rimini, Ravenna, San Marino, Ancona,
Loreto, Terni, Narni, Orvieto, Viterbo, Ferento, Bagnaja,
Monte Fiascone, Rome, Tivoli, Milan.</p>

<p class='c016'>As soon as we had left the mountain heights of Arezzo and
Cortona, the Etruscan eyries from which the Romans marched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>down to their red fate on the shores of the lake Trasimene,
we learned how hot mid-Italy can be in midsummer. Even
on the rock of Perugia, fifteen hundred feet above the sea,
you could not walk on the sunny side of the street without
an umbrella on account of the risk of sunstroke, and the
heat was almost unendurable as we drove across the hills
the thirty or forty miles to Todi, a little city which the Gods
of the Middle Ages have kept to themselves.</p>

<p class='c016'>Perugia was always defiant, from Etruscan times. With a
man like Duke Frederick of Urbino to rule and lead its fierce
citizens, Perugia would have been more potent than Urbino,
or Rimini, or Mantua, or Ferrara, perhaps a city of the first
rank, like Milan or Florence. Its rock made the whole city
a citadel, and it sits astride the road from Rome to the Alps,
with the fertile Vale of Umbria to provision it.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Vale of Umbria below Assisi is only rivalled by the
shores of Lake Trasimene in the beauty of its women—we
know them from the pictures of Raphael, Perugino, and
Pinturricchio. I wish I could put its magic into words—the
nobility of its farm-houses, the soft grace of its orchards
and olive-gardens, its antique hermitages.</p>

<p class='c016'>Summer in the Vale of Umbria was perfect, and certain of
its beauties were such as could only be seen in summer, like
the translucent sources of the Clitumnus, which, with their
lawny banks, remind you of the Twenty-third Psalm. I
would rather go and see them, below the tall poplars which are
a landmark across the plain, than the graceful little Roman
temple above them, which is a landmark for travellers.</p>

<p class='c016'>Foligno is only a walk from exquisite Spello, a city which
is a hill covered with Gothic houses. Foligno and the cities
on the hills round it are rich in great pictures by small
masters; but Spoleto is, after Perugia, the prize city of Umbria.
It is rich in monuments of all ages; in its walls it has
prehistoric masonry of three ages; it defied the assaults of
Hannibal; you can still see the house of Vespasian’s mother,
and other Roman monuments of the classic age; it is rich
in the handiwork of the forgotten centuries which followed;
it has a church built like a pagan temple in the fourth century
after Christ; it has the most stupendous aqueduct in Italy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>carried across a valley from the hill of Groves, on arches
two hundred and fifty feet high; and a unique cathedral,
planted in the valley, like its other great church; it was the
capital of the only King of Italy who bore the title before
Victor Emmanuel. Standing on the hillside, embosomed in
groves, looking over the plain, in an amphitheatre of mountains,
Spoleto is a place which never leaves the memory.</p>

<p class='c016'>We went straight from it to most famous cities—Gubbio
was not its equal, except when the sunset fired the façade of
its city hall, six hundred years old and three hundred feet
high; and Urbino, on its dizzy height, crowned with the
fantastic palace of Duke Frederick, is a prosaic place beside
it; Ravenna, for all its mosaiced churches, built by Justinian
and his successors, when the first millennium was half spent,
has no glory of site, nor has Rimini; Ancona has only its
site and its glorious Byzantine cathedral, on a green hill
between two seas.</p>

<p class='c016'>We wandered from town to town such as these; we drove
all day from Rimini to San Marino, the castled eagle’s nest,
which is still an independent Republic; we went to Loreto
on the Virgin’s day, and saw peasants, who had come in
ox-carts from the recesses of the Apennines. We stood below
and above the stupendous waterfalls of Terni, the most
stupendous in Europe. But we saw no naturally nobler
city than Spoleto.</p>

<p class='c016'>All that summer we wandered about the byways of Tuscany,
Umbria, Latium, and the March of Ancona. We hardly
ever saw an English face. We stayed for the most part in
humble native inns. It was a hot summer, even for Italy,
but we were not frightened by the heat from going where we
meant to go, nor by the fetish of malaria, for we stayed a
week at Ravenna in September. We never enjoyed ourselves
more in our lives. We tested an Italian summer fairly on
the hot plains and sun-baked hills. I needed the experience
to write <i>How to See Italy</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>It was a guide-book on a new principle. While I was writing
of the cities and scenery of Italy, generally I grouped them in
provinces, but I devoted other chapters to the hobbies of
travellers. I told the lover of paintings where all the best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>paintings in Italy are to be found, and which places have the
richest galleries. I did the same for the lovers of architecture,
sculpture, mosaics, and scenery. I told the traveller how
to see all the principal sights of Italy by rail, without going
the same railway journey twice, and I tried to convert English
travellers to the delightful native inns of Italy, and I gave them
the prices of inns all over Italy.</p>

<p class='c016'>The idea of the book was, briefly, to enable any one to
see at a glance which parts of Italy he ought to visit in pursuit
of his special studies. And I had three special chapters on
the changes in Rome, which have made all the old books on
Rome out of date.</p>

<p class='c016'>When we reached London in the late autumn, I found a
sad change in my father, who had reached the great age
of eighty-six. He had lost much of his memory, and very
often did not care to speak. He gradually failed, until one
night between Christmas and the New Year he passed away
quite peacefully, holding my hand.</p>

<p class='c016'>I sold the house on Campden Hill—Phillimore Lodge—in
which he had lived for nearly fifty years, to Sir Walter Phillimore.
The estate was so burdened with legacies, made
while he was a much richer man, that I should have lost by
accepting my inheritance if I had not sold all the real estate.</p>

<p class='c016'>I had no wish to live there. For years it had been my intention
to leave London when I no longer had my father to
consider. I wanted to go to some rural spot just outside
London, where I could have pleasure in being at home in the
summer months, because I like going abroad in the winter,
and you must make use of your house some time during the
year. At Addison Mansions we were only at home for a
month or two in some years.</p>

<p class='c016'>I set about looking for a new house almost immediately,
and after nearly taking an old Queen Anne mansion in the
Sheen Road, finally settled on the Avenue House, Richmond,
which stands in the north-west corner of the old Green, with
its front windows looking down the Avenue, and across the
Green to the Old Palace, and its back windows looking over
the old Deer Park and the Mid-Surrey Golf Club to the trees
of Kew Gardens. In the winter we can see a mile or two of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>grass and trees from those windows, and the river when the
tide is high. The house suited me perfectly; it had a charming
old-fashioned garden, with ancient trees, a cedar of Lebanon,
a mulberry, and an arbutus, which covers itself with flowers
and fruit, among them, besides two great wistarias and many
flowering laburnums, lilacs and hawthorns. I added rockeries
in the Sicilian style, and various features of a Japanese
garden.</p>

<p class='c016'>The house had the further advantage of being only a few
minutes’ walk from the railway stations, from golf at Mid-Surrey,
and from one of the most beautiful reaches of the
Thames.</p>

<p class='c016'>Here I have written the present book, <i>The Unholy Estate</i>,
<i>The Curse of the Nile</i>, and my parts of <i>Adam Lindsay Gordon
and His Friends in England and Australia</i>, and <i>Weeds</i>; and
I was here when <i>How to see Italy</i> was published.</p>

<p class='c016'>I was sorry in a way to say good-bye to Addison Mansions,
which had been my home during the most interesting years
of my life. I liked the rooms; I should have liked to transport
them to Richmond.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XIX<br /> <br /><span class='c022'>HOW I WROTE “WHO’S WHO”</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Of</span> all the books I have written, none have attracted more
attention than <i>Who’s Who</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>Various biographical dictionaries of living persons were
in existence before the new <i>Who’s Who</i> appeared in 1897—<i>Men
of the Time</i>, <i>People of the Period</i>, and so on. But none
of them were annual, and none of them were published at a
popular price. I myself had attempted to get a cheap
annual biographical dictionary published, before A. &amp; C.
Black came to me with their proposal about <i>Who’s Who</i>. I
put the idea into the hands of a literary agent for sale. It
was very much on the lines of <i>Who’s Who</i>, but not on so
ambitious a scale, and I thought that Sell, who has a Press
directory, might be likely to buy it. No one did buy it,
and when I told an interviewer, who came to get “copy”
out of me about <i>Who’s Who</i>, about it, that agent was wrong-headed
enough to think that I was trying to libel him, instead
of trying to claim originality for my idea.</p>

<p class='c016'>However that may be, Adam Black, one day, when I was
talking to him about my novel, <i>A Japanese Marriage</i>, which
A. &amp; C. Black had published, produced a copy of the old
<i>Who’s Who</i>, an insignificant pocket-peerage, of which he
had just purchased the rights, and asked if I could make anything
of it for the firm. Having made a synopsis of my own
idea for that literary agent to sell, I had it cut and dry,
and it was settled that I should do the book as soon as the
agreement could be drawn up. As events proved, it was drawn
up too hurriedly, for I signed it without insisting on the clause
which has gone into all my other agreements of the same kind—that,
in case the publishers wished to be released from the
agreement because the book was not as successful as they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>hoped, the book should become my property. I do not say
that the Blacks would have consented to the insertion of
this clause, but it is certain that I ought never to have signed
it without, because I put into it ideas, whose originality
and value has abundantly been proved since. It was agreed
that I should edit it for three years certain, but that if the
book was not successful by then the agreement should
terminate. At the end of the three years, they determined
that the book was not a success, and terminated the agreement.
At the time that I wrote this book there was no one in
London with the same knowledge as I had as to who should
be included in the book, because my three years’ work in
New York papers had made me take up biographical journalism—a
profession which did not exist in London till I brought
it over from America, and which never took permanent
root in England. In fact, it very soon withered out of
existence.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is an odd fact that this book in its dried pippin form,
which went on for about half a century before it was expanded,
never struck the world as having a specially good title, till
Adam Black recognised its value, though now its title is
regarded as a stroke of genius.</p>

<p class='c016'>“But how are you going to get the information?” he
asked, when I had detailed my formula for the biographies,
much the same as that which is used for <i>Who’s Who</i> now,
with the exception of the details about telephones and motors,
which were not part of English everyday life in 1897, and a
few other points which I ought to have thought of.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I shall make the people themselves give it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But will they ever do it?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I think so, if we give them proper forms to fill up, and
get a well-known peer and a well-known commoner to fill
up their forms as specimens before we send the others out.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You’ll have to tell them that you’re going to use their
biographies as specimens. I wish nothing to be done of which
anybody could complain.”</p>

<p class='c016'>In the matter of the special stationery provided for the
purpose, the firm were extraordinarily liberal. They only
studied attractiveness, just as they had special type cast for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>setting up the book because none of the small types offered to
us were sufficiently beautiful. The selection of the long blue
envelopes, opening at the side, has an almost public interest.
Adam Black requested that we should leave the matter of
envelopes over until the following week, when he was to meet
Lord Rosebery on the yacht of his brother-in-law, George
Coates. When Lord Rosebery was asked what kind of
envelope he should treat with most respect in opening his
correspondence, Lord Rosebery pronounced in favour of this
particular form of long blue envelope, because it was used by
the Cabinet for their communications. So we adopted it,
and the first persons in official circles who received it may have
experienced a strange flutter of expectation, because we did
not in those days, I think, have the envelopes stamped
<i>Who’s Who</i>, lest they should defeat their object of being
taken for Cabinet communications.</p>

<p class='c016'>Then came the question of whom we should invite to write
their biographies to be models for the biographies of other
people. I selected the Duke of Rutland for the peers, and
Mr. Balfour for the commoners. The Duke, both as Lord
John Manners and as Duke, had occupied one of the first
places in the eyes of his fellow-countrymen. He had filled
his place in the Cabinet with distinction; he had been the
typical aristocrat; his exquisite politeness had helped the
democracy to forgive him for writing “Let Wealth and
Commerce ... die. But give us still our old nobility.”</p>

<p class='c016'>I wrote to ask him to fill the biographical form, which I had
drawn up, to be the model for other members of the peerage,
and with his usual consideration, he acceded. Then I wrote
to Mr. Balfour to ask him to write his biography, to be a model
for the untitled. The only title he bore was so proud that
we usually, as I did then, forget to reckon it among titles—the
“Right Honourable.” Mr. Balfour, too, acceded, and
he was particularly suitable, because, in addition to being the
first man in the House of Commons, recreation had a real
meaning in his case, since he was known to be an inveterate
golfer.</p>

<p class='c016'>The idea of adding “recreations” to the more serious
items which had been included in previous biographical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>dictionaries was adopted at one of the councils of war
which we used to hold in the partners’ room of A. &amp; C.
Black, at 4 Soho Square. And for selling purposes it
proved far and away the best idea in the whole book, when it
was published. The newspapers were never tired of quoting
the recreations of eminent people, thus giving the book a
succession of advertisements of its readability, and shop-keepers
who catered for their various sports bought the book
to get the addresses of the eminent people, who were, many
of them, very indignant at the Niagara of circulars which
resulted.</p>

<p class='c016'>I wonder if many people remember the old <i>Who’s Who?</i>—a
little red 32mo, which looked something like the Infantry
Manual with its clasp knocked off. It was a sort of badly kept
index to the Peerage, as futile as an 1840 Beauty Book.
We turned it into a dictionary of biography for living people,
and we made it eternally interesting by persuading the people
whom we included in it to give us their favourite recreations.
I chose (from an un-annual biographical dictionary edited by
Humphry Ward) the type, which had to be specially cast
for it; I chose the people who deserved to be included in it;
I drafted the letters and the forms to be filled up, which were
sent to each person; and I persuaded those two very eminent
men to be the bell-wethers for persuading other people to
fill up their forms, an idea which was crowned with success.
The late Duke of Rutland’s and Mr. Balfour’s fillings up of
the forms were printed at the heads of the forms sent out to
other people, and few people objected to following where they
had led the way. But among these few recalcitrants were
Lord Salisbury and Mr. Chamberlain, and most naval officers.
Army officers, on the other hand, were generally very obliging.
Architects and literary men filled up their forms best,
artists and actresses worst, though actors were almost as
bad. You would have thought that the actual formation
of the letters in framing a reply was a torture to artists,
actors and naval officers. The actresses, if you had compiled
the biographies by interview, would have asked for two columns
each.</p>

<p class='c016'>Many people thought it necessary to write me rude letters,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>demanding what right I had to intrude upon their privacy,
and ordering me not to include their names. To one of them,
the head of an Oxford College, I wrote, “Dear Sir, If you had
not been head of —— College, no one would have dreamt of
including you, but since you are, you will have to go in whether
you like it or not.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The late Duke of Devonshire said that his recreation had
formerly been hunting. One man said that he did not see
how the ownership of four hundred and fifty thousand acres
made him a public person. A prominent authoress first
of all refused to fill up her form at all. I wrote to tell her
that in that case I should have to fill it up for her. She
showed no concern about this until I sent her a proof of the
biography, in which I made her out ten years older than she
really was, and said that I meant to insert the biography in
that form unless there was anything she wished to correct.
She then corrected it, and added so much that it would have
taken the whole column if I had inserted all she sent.</p>

<p class='c016'>W. S. Gilbert wrote the rudest letter of anybody. He said
he was always being pestered by unimportant people for
information about himself. So I put him down in the book
as “Writer of Verses and the libretti to Sir Arthur Sullivan’s
comic operas.” He then wrote me a letter of about a thousand
words, in which he asked me if that was the way to treat a
man who had written seventy original dramas. Next year
he filled up his form as readily as a peer’s widow who has
married a commoner.</p>

<p class='c016'>Bernard Shaw said in 1897 that his favourite recreations
were cycling and showing off, and informed the world that
he was of middle-class family, was not educated at all
“academically,” and coming to London when he was twenty,
for many years could obtain no literary recognition, even to
the extent of employment as a journalist.</p>

<p class='c016'>But the most humorous experience I had in connection
with <i>Who’s Who</i> was when I succeeded in bringing a certain
actor-manager to book. He had repeatedly promised to
fill in his form, and failed to do so, when I found myself next
to him at a public dinner to which we had both been invited.
“Why did you not send me that biography?” I asked him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>and he said, “Well, the real reason is that I thought I should
have to say how damned badly I have behaved to my wife.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The book was a complete literary success; the newspapers
gave it column reviews, chiefly consisting of the unsuitable
recreations of prominent people.</p>

<p class='c016'>When I edited it, <i>Who’s Who</i> contained a great deal of
information besides the biographies, such as lists of peculiarly
pronounced proper names, keys to the pseudonyms of prominent
people, names of the editors of the principal papers.
Some of the real names were so unreasonable that people wrote
to know why they were not included in the lists of pseudonyms;
one of these was Sir Louis Forget.</p>

<p class='c016'>Ascertaining the correct pronunciation of peculiar names
was very diverting; there was such a divergence of opinion
among people of Scottish birth about words like “Brechin.”
I was bewailing their egotism to the late Lord Southesk,
when he said, “I have been collecting peculiarly pronounced
Scottish names and their proper pronunciation for years.
You can have my list.”</p>

<p class='c016'>I thanked him and gladly inserted them all. A very good
friend of mine, the late Hugh Maclaughlan, who was sub-editor
of the <i>Star and Leader</i>, in reviewing the book over his own
name, found great fault with my Cockney pronunciation
of the Scottish names. I do not know to this day whether
he was serious, or, as schoolboys say, “pulling my leg,” and
in any case, I did not mind, but Lord Southesk was furious.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Tell Mr. Maclaughlan,” he said, “that I am the man whom
he called a Cockney, and that my ancestor commanded the
Highlanders at the battle of Harlaw.” Harlaw was the last
great battle between the Highlanders and the Lowlanders,
and was fought in the year 1411.</p>

<p class='c016'>One of the funniest entries in the book was made by a
famous authoress, who wrote in her biography “she is at
present unmarried.”</p>

<p class='c016'>One of the most amusing experiences I had when I was
editor of <i>Who’s Who</i> was my receiving a message from a
Mrs. Williams or Williamson, asking me to call on her upon
a matter of great importance. I imagined that at the very
least Queen Victoria (Mrs. Williams was supposed to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>influence in such matters) had deputed her to offer me a
knighthood. At any rate, from the tone of her letter, it
ought to have been a considerable advantage of some sort
which was to be bestowed upon me. I was not much flustered
because the lady had not the reputation of giving anything
for nothing. But I own I was rather taken aback when I
was shown into her den, and she said, “I sent for you because
Mrs. Dotheboy Tompkins”—or some such name—nobody of
the slightest importance—“wishes you to put her into
<i>Who’s Who</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>I said, “The only answer I can give you is that I do not
consider Mrs. Tompkins of sufficient importance. I don’t
know how you will break this to her. Good-afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c016'>It was such colossal impertinence, her sending for me instead
of writing to me, though that would have been bad enough,
that I was determined not to spare her.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XX<br /> <br /><span class='c022'>AUSTRALIANS IN LITERATURE</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>As</span> I lived four or five years in Australia, and have written
various books upon Australian poets, and as both my wife
and my son are Victorians by birth, it is natural for me to
devote a chapter to Australians in literature whom I have
known, counting both people from the Old Country who
became Australians by residence, and those who were born
or educated in Australia, though their writing career has
been in England.</p>

<p class='c016'>I never met either Gordon or Kendall—Adam Lindsay
Gordon and Henry Clarence Kendall, the twin stars of
Australian poetry, naturally come first to one’s mind in
writing of Australian literature, because poetry in Australia,
as usual, preceded prose as an art.</p>

<p class='c016'>Gordon, whose nephew, Henry Ratti, living in London,
had just placed himself in communication with me in a
couple of long letters, and invited me to lunch when he died
so prematurely, had been dead for nearly ten years before
I landed in Australia. But Kendall did not die till I had
been in Australia for nearly three years. I was in Victoria
when he died; I think I had actually been appointed to the
Chair of Modern History in the University of Sydney before
it happened, so I missed him by a very narrow margin.
So little stir did his death cause in Victoria that I never
even heard of it, and imagined that he had been dead for
years, though he wrote lyrics only excelled in music by
Shelley’s, Swinburne’s and Poe’s in the whole of English
literature. Yet he had visited Melbourne, and was, in
fact, there and in the company of Gordon the very day
before his rival died. Kendall, unlike Gordon, was Australian
born.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>Far the greatest author born on Australian soil is, of
course, Mrs. Humphry Ward, a Tasmanian by birth, though
Australia had long passed out of her life before she wrote.
“Tasma” was also a Tasmanian by birth, and “George
Egerton,” whose father, Captain Dunne, fought in the New
Zealand war, was born in Melbourne.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mrs. Campbell Praed, on the other hand, was not only
born in Queensland, the daughter of a prominent Queensland
politician, Thomas Lodge Murray Prior, but has gone to her
native land for the scene of her brilliant novels. Ill-health
kept her from coming often to Addison Mansions, where she
had a double claim to literary homage, for, apart from her
own eminence as a novelist, she has a matrimonial connection
with William Mackworth Praed, the brilliant novelist
and father of Society Poetry.</p>

<p class='c016'>Rolf Boldrewood, though born in London, has been so
long in Australia that he almost counts as a Colonial
(Australian born) rather than a Colonist (settler). He went
to the old Sydney College in New South Wales more than
seventy years ago, and though he spent the greater part of
his life as a Police Magistrate and Warden of the gold-fields
in New South Wales, began life as one of the pioneer squatters
of Victoria. His experiences gave him a rich equipment for
writing tales of wild life in the old Colonial days, like <i>Robbery
Under Arms</i>, with which he made such a huge reputation in
1888. I remember him as a writer ten years before that,
when he used to send a weekly <i>causerie</i> to the <i>Australasian</i>,
admirably written under his famous pseudonym. I believe
that he used to call it “Under the Greenwood Tree.” He had
already written and published the novel which he afterwards
called <i>The Squatter’s Dream</i>. It was a thin paper volume,
a sort of cross between our sixpennies and the French three
francs fifty coverless novels, and it was called in those days
<i>Ups and Downs</i>. It was a true story; it dealt with the ups
and downs of the famous Mossgiel Station, which made
John Simson’s great fortune, and the ruin by drought of
the De Salis brothers who had the station before him. It
was published anonymously. Rolf Boldrewood’s real name
is Thomas Alexander Browne. His mother was a Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>Alexander. Both the Brownes and the Alexanders were
huge men; Rolf’s brother, Sylvester Browne, was the tallest
man in Australia, a couple of inches taller than my uncle,
Sir Charles (who was just under six foot six, and I think may
have owed some of his influence in the early days to his
great stature). The Brownes were not only very tall, but
very strongly-built men. Their adventurousness took them
to West Australia, where they made large fortunes during
the mining boom.</p>

<p class='c016'>Guy Boothby and Louis Becke, on the other hand, both
much younger men, were real Colonials, Becke having been
born at Port Macquarie, New South Wales, and Boothby at
Adelaide, where his father was a member of Parliament and
his grandfather a Judge. That did not prevent him from
leading the wildest life. At one time he was an explorer and
crossed Australia from north to south. At another time he
was stoker on a tramp steamer trading between Singapore
and Borneo. He “struck oil” with the detective stories of
Dr. Nikola, which the <i>Windsor Magazine</i> ran in opposition
to Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes stories in the <i>Strand Magazine</i>,
and at one time was making nine thousand a year out of his
writing. I remember his chartering an eight hundred ton
steam yacht, and he had some wonderful prize dogs at the
Manor House, close to the Kempton Park racecourse, in
which he lived.</p>

<p class='c016'>Becke was never so fortunate in his earnings, though he
was a far superior writer. He acquired his wonderful knowledge
of the Australian coast and the South Sea Islands as
supercargo of one of the schooners which trade between
the islands and Sydney. He was one of Fisher Unwin’s
discoveries, and came very near achieving a <i>Kidnapped</i>
and <i>Treasure Island</i> success, for which, as far as first-hand
knowledge was concerned, he was infinitely better equipped
than Stevenson.</p>

<p class='c016'>Frank Bullen, Becke’s rival in South Sea knowledge, was
not an Australian, but born in Paddington. Like Becke, he
was in the Merchant Service. I have more to say about him
in another chapter.</p>

<p class='c016'>Ada Cambridge, who was for a long time the best-known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>novel-writer in Australia, was born in Norfolk, and spent
all her time in East Anglia till she married the Rev. J. F.
Cross, and sailed with him to Australia in 1870, the year of
Adam Lindsay Gordon’s death. She published her first
novel about seven years later. Cambridge was her maiden
name.</p>

<p class='c016'>Ethel Turner, Mrs. H. R. Curlewis, is another of the few
Australian authors living in Australia who have had large
publics in England. As a reviewer, I hailed with delight her
first books, <i>Seven Little Australians</i> and <i>The Family at Mis-Rule</i>,
and prophesied the wide and continuous success which
she has attained with her stories of child life in Australia.
Mrs. Curlewis was born in Yorkshire, but she has lived in
Sydney ever since I can remember.</p>

<p class='c016'>Frances Campbell (Mrs. Howard Douglas Campbell), the
author of <i>Love the Atonement</i>, <i>The Two Queenslanders</i>, and
other novels, married a cousin of the late Duke of Argyll, who
was out in Queensland, and commenced writing at his Grace’s
suggestion. In point of fact, she came to us with a letter of
introduction from him. Since then she has been an active
and successful journalist, doing several special journeys
abroad as correspondent for the great London dailies. She
is not to be confused with Mrs. Vere Douglas Campbell, the
mother of Marjorie Bowen, who is also a novelist. I made
the mistake myself once.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mrs. Mannington Caffyn, who under the pseudonym of
“Iota” wrote the famous <i>A Yellow Aster</i>, was a beautiful
and spirited Irish girl, the daughter of a country gentleman,
who took to hospital nursing as a profession, and married a
doctor, whose ill-health drove him to Australia. Her life
there was full of hard experiences, but she did not make a
mark in literature till her return to England. Andrew Lang
was struck with the extraordinary ability of <i>A Yellow
Aster</i>, and urged with all his influence one of the old classical
publishing houses to bring it out, but in vain. Hutchinson
saw his opportunity, accepted the book, advertised it with
genius, and made a colossal success of it. Other successes
followed, so real that she was able to send her growing boys
to a crack public school. Another novelist not born in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>Australia, but resident there for some years, was “Rita,”
who was educated in Sydney.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Countess von Arnim, author of a delightful series of
books from <i>Elizabeth and Her German Garden</i> to <i>Fraulein
Schmidt</i> and <i>Mr. Anstruther</i>, was an Australian born, the
daughter of Mr. Herron Beauchamp.</p>

<p class='c016'>Haddon Chambers, one of my earliest literary friends in
London, though I have seen little of him for many years, I
met because we came from Australia at about the same time.
He was born near Sydney, of Irish parents, and was for a
while in the New South Wales Civil Service, like his father
before him. Feeling, as I did, that Australia was no place
for a literary career, he visited England when he was twenty,
and returned to England for good when he was twenty-two,
a handsome, alert, indomitable Australian boy. He looked
very boyish in those days. Beginning life in England as a
journalist and story-writer, he suddenly took London by
storm with his play, <i>Captain Swift</i>. Captain Swift was
one of the greatest parts which Beerbohm-Tree has created,
and from that time forward Chambers became one of the
dramatists who count.</p>

<p class='c016'>To my mind, the best author living in Australia at the
present moment is the Rev. William Henry Fitchett,
President of the General Conference of the Methodist Church
of Australia, editor of a magazine and a weekly newspaper,
and Principal of a ladies’ college in Melbourne. He made
his name with a series of remarkable books about the exploits
of the British army—writing at first under the pseudonym
of “Vedette.” Few men have ever written so brilliantly
or so sympathetically on the subject as the author of <i>Fights
for the Flag</i> and <i>Deeds that Won the Empire</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>A. B. Paterson, the poet who wrote “The Man from Snowy
River,” is an Australian by birth and residence. He is
another of the few Australian authors who have a vogue in
England without ever having lived there. He is recognised
not only as one of the chief poets of Australia, but as a
publicist. He is a solicitor by profession.</p>

<p class='c016'>W. H. Ogilvy, the best living Australian poet, was not
born in Australia, nor does he live there now, but he spent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>many years in the Australian bush, and caught its spirit
better than any poet except Adam Lindsay Gordon.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Countess of Darnley, who wrote some fiction a few
years ago, was the beauty of Melbourne when I was there
in the ’eighties. Lord Darnley met her when he came out
to Australia with one of the English cricket elevens. He
was then the Hon. Ivo Bligh, a name which will never be
forgotten in the history of sport.</p>

<p class='c016'>The charming and elegant Eleanor Mordaunt, author of
<i>Lu of the Ranges</i>, the best novel ever written about hardships
in Australia, is English by birth.</p>

<p class='c016'>“<i>Lu of the Ranges</i>,” says a <i>nil admirari</i> Australian newspaper,
whose editor could not have known that she was born
in England, “is a notable contribution to Australian literature....
It is solidly constructed, finely written, frank to
the verge of brutality, and inherently Australian. Lu,
pictured on the cover by the fool illustrator as a charming
English maiden, is a drab and very human girl of the backwoods,
who, to the end of her life, could not speak grammatically.
Her language is the sort that looks neater
printed with a dash; and she has a temper of her own. A
hard, glittering, valiant personality, whom life teaches to
take care of herself ‘on her own.’</p>

<p class='c016'>“A veritable child of the bush, she was inured alike to
heat and cold, to hard work and a spare diet, to an almost
incredible isolation.... For the children of the bush are,
above all things, old, like the primitive forms of vegetation,
the wistful-eyed, prehistoric animals which are with their
fellows. When they grow up and find their way to the
cities, they blossom into a splendid youth, which never again
quite leaves them; or else, scared and bewildered, they creep
back again to the wild places whence they came. But to
the irresponsible gaiety of childhood they are for ever
strangers.”</p>

<p class='c016'>It was the outcome of the seven years of struggles, more
than once coming perilously near starvation, which she had
in the colony of Victoria. Some of her short stories are good
enough for Rudyard Kipling. That she has not assumed her
place in the front rank of novelists is due only to the immense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>barriers to recognition which have to be surmounted owing
to the mountains of fiction which are cast up every year, and
stand between the new writer and fame.</p>

<p class='c016'>When I asked Eleanor Mordaunt about her life in
Australia she said—</p>

<p class='c016'>“In Australia I edited a woman’s paper, and made
gardens, and blouses for tea-room girls, and worked in an
engineer’s shop at metal work, and was four times carried
into public hospitals for dying. I never had a penny in the
bank—and more than once not in the world. Once I lay in
bed for three days because I had nothing to eat. Then
came thirty pounds for a manuscript of essays from <i>Lothian</i>
of Melbourne (published 1909 under the title of <i>Rosemary</i>),
and seven pounds a woman owed me for painting her a set
of silk curtains, and two pounds for <i>The Garden of Contentment</i>,
and I got up and went out and bought a pound of
chops, and cooked and ate them all. I did all my housework
at night, and all the washing.</p>

<p class='c016'>“In Leek this time I lived on fifteen shillings a week with
the weavers, and knew no one else except the two daughters
of the Trade Union secretary, and never had so much love
and kindness in my life. The book comes out next autumn,
and is called <i>Bellamy</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mary Gaunt, the novelist and traveller, was born and
brought up in Victoria. Her father was a well-known
judge in the Colony. She had met with considerable success
in journalism before she left the Melbourne University.</p>

<p class='c016'>Dr. George Ernest Morrison, who made himself so famous
as correspondent of <i>The Times</i> in Peking, was, as I have said
elsewhere, a fellow-student and friend of mine at the
Melbourne University, and has been a great friend ever
since. It was I who persuaded Horace Cox to publish his
<i>An Australian in China</i>, the only book he has ever published,
though I myself conveyed to him an offer of a thousand
pounds on account for a book about China before the Allied
Powers invaded it. He was unwilling to enter into a contract,
and the matter dropped. He has since then resigned
his position on <i>The Times</i>, and become English adviser to
the Government of China. His book on China, whenever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>it does come, will be read all over the world, because no
European has ever understood Chinese politics as well as
he has.</p>

<p class='c016'>His knowledge of the country Chinese, the two hundred
million toiling agricultural poor, is just as extraordinary.
His gigantic journeys across China have given him a chance
of seeing them as no other Anglo-Saxon, and probably no
other white man, ever has seen them. His first journey
was from Shanghai to Rangoon by land in 1894, which he
accomplished at a cost of eighteen pounds, and on which
he went unarmed, as usual. That is the journey described
in <i>An Australian in China</i>. His second was from Bangkok
in Siam to Yunnan city in China and round Tonquin in 1896;
his third across Manchuria from Stretensk in Siberia to
Vladivostok; his fourth from Peking to the border of Tonquin;
his fifth from Honan city in Central China across Asia
to Andijan in Russian Turkestan, nearly four thousand miles.</p>

<p class='c016'>Morrison, whenever he came back to England from the
East, used to come straight to Addison Mansions. One night
he turned up about 10 p.m.</p>

<p class='c016'>“How long have you been in London?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c016'>“About two hours.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The hero of so many striking adventures (in which most
people would feel inclined to include the siege of Peking,
for he was badly wounded in it, and without his leadership
the city would have fallen) is, though his bushy hair has
turned snow-white, singularly youthful-looking. His rounded
clean-shaven face has not a line or a wrinkle from its long
sojourn under Eastern suns. His blue eye has a merry
twinkle in it which gives his face a humorous expression when
it is not hardened for action. Those who have seen him in
a crisis, know how stern and resolute and uncompromising
it can be. He has a slim, active figure.</p>

<p class='c016'>Just before he was appointed <i>Times</i> correspondent in
China, I approached Sir Henry Norman, who was at that
time one of the editors of the <i>Daily Chronicle</i>, and whom
I knew, to try and get the proprietors of that paper to give
him a similar appointment in China, or in some country
where Spanish is spoken, for Morrison speaks Spanish fluently.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>I enumerated all the qualifications which immediately
afterwards led <i>The Times</i> to make the best appointment
they made since De Blowitz. At the end of it Norman just
said with a cold smile, “Oh, all your geese are swans,” and
changed the subject. I wondered if he ever let the proprietors
of the <i>Chronicle</i> know what a goose they had lost,
and whom they could have secured for quite a moderate
salary. To his honour be it known, that Moberly Bell, of
<i>The Times</i>, recognised Morrison’s value the moment the
young doctor approached him.</p>

<p class='c016'>Morrison’s middle fame was of a quite unusual sort. His
walk across Australia without money and without arms had
been a nine days’ wonder. His gallant explorations in New
Guinea, culminating in his being brought home with a barbed
wooden spear-head inside him, and being sent on to Edinburgh
because no one in Australia could extract it, made
him a celebrity in Scotland as well as Melbourne. But
when Prof. Chiene extracted the spear-head successfully,
Morrison’s exploits, for the time being, were lost sight of in
those of the great surgeon, and he became known as “Chiene’s
case.”</p>

<p class='c016'>G. W. Rusden, the only important historian of New
Zealand and Australia till Henry Gyles Turner’s book appeared,
I knew very well. We lived together, until I was
married, at Cotmandene, Punt Road, South Yarra, a suburb
of Melbourne. In fact, I was married from there. He had
for many years been clerk of the Parliaments in Melbourne,
and was actually engaged in writing his histories when we
were living together. He was a strange mixture in his
sentiments—a violent Tory in everything except where
natives were concerned. But he was even more violent as
an advocate for coloured people. At that time the Maories
were giving a good deal of trouble in New Zealand, and
Bryce, the Minister for Native Affairs, showed great resolution
and capacity in dealing with them. This infuriated
Rusden, who, partly from the yellow journals in New Zealand,
and partly from Sir George Grey, who had been Governor and
afterwards Premier of the Colony, gleaned a farrago of libels,
accusing Bryce of murdering native women and children. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>showed these reports to me triumphantly. At the risk of
losing his friendship, for he was very touchy, I begged him
not to make any use of these materials, which appeared to
me patently false. But he persisted in inserting portions
of them. Years afterwards, when both he and I were living
in England, Bryce brought an action for libel against him in
the London Courts on these very grounds. Rusden went to
my uncle’s firm, Sladen and Wing, as his solicitors, on account
of his friendship with my other uncle, Sir Charles. My
cousin told me about it. “Well,” I said, “make him pay
anything to keep it out of court. I was living with him
when he wrote that part of his history, and saw the materials,
and he hasn’t a leg to stand on.”</p>

<p class='c016'>But Rusden was a great deal too stubborn to compromise—and
the verdict against him was five thousand pounds
damages.</p>

<p class='c016'>Turner also is an old friend of mine. He was long manager
of the Commercial Bank in Melbourne, and was one of the
founders and editors of the <i>Melbourne Review</i>. He and the
late Alexander Sutherland, who was a schoolmaster, wrote
the excellent book on Australian literature which has been
the foundation of all subsequent works on the subject,
especially in the matter of our knowledge of Adam Lindsay
Gordon.</p>

<p class='c016'>And here I must mention my two closest Australian
literary friends—Arthur Patchett Martin and Margaret
Thomas. Margaret Thomas, who was brought up in
Australia, though she was actually born in England, began
life as a sculptor. She won the silver medal of the Royal
Academy, and executed, among other public works, the
memorial to Richard Jefferies in Salisbury Cathedral, and
the memorials to various Somerset celebrities in the Somerset
Valhalla, founded by the Kinglakes at Taunton. She was
so successful also as a portrait painter that she was able to
retire with a competency, and devote the rest of her life
to travel and book-writing. She has written travel-books
on Syria, Spain and Morocco, and hand-books on painting
and sculpture. Probably no one living has such a wide
knowledge of the picture-galleries of the Continent.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>Patchett Martin was born at Woolwich, but went to
Australia at an early age, and was educated at the Melbourne
Grammar School and University. He helped to found, and
edited the <i>Melbourne Review</i>, and was intimately associated
with the theatre, because his sister married Garner, the
principal theatrical impresario of Australia. He settled in
London in 1882, and practically introduced Adam Lindsay
Gordon’s poems to their popularity in England, where they
had been neglected except for the reviews and articles which
appeared in <i>Baily’s Magazine</i>, about the time of Gordon’s
death a dozen years before. While editor of the <i>Melbourne
Review</i>, Martin was among the very first to “boom” Robert
Louis Stevenson, who was his model in his own delightful
poems and essays. His big, burly form and hot, good-humoured
face were very familiar in the Savage Club in the
’eighties.</p>

<p class='c016'>Australian authors in London centre round the Royal
Colonial Institute, and the <i>British Australasian</i>, the editor of
which, Mr. Chomley, is the secretary of the literary circle at
the Royal Colonial Institute, which meets on Thursday
nights, and has most interesting papers and discussions.</p>

<p class='c016'>Both the former librarian (my old friend, J. R. Boosè,
who is now the secretary) and the present, P. Evans Lewin,
who was for a brief period the chief librarian of South
Australia, have kept the track of nearly every book which
has been published about Australia or by an Australian,
and Australian authors and journalists make a regular club
of the Institute when they are in London.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXI<br /> <br /><span class='c022'>MY NOVELIST FRIENDS: PART I</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>By</span> far the greater number of my literary friends have been
novelists. I have counted no less than two hundred and
seventy male novelists who have visited us at Addison
Mansions, and I have no doubt that I have forgotten enough
to bring the number up to three hundred.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of Walter Besant, a short sturdy man, with a bushy brown
beard and blue eyes behind spectacles, which could be
very merry or very indignant, I have spoken elsewhere.
Besant, who pronounced his name with the accent on the
second syllable (it is said because people always pronounced
the famous theosophist’s name with the accent on the first
syllable, though the recollection of its Byzantine etymology
may also have guided him), was very outspoken. He could
not abide the famous Annie Besant; he considered that she
was a millstone about his brother’s neck, and made no bones
over saying so. That brother was a master at Cheltenham
College when I first went there. But I do not remember if
I ever saw Mrs. Besant there, though we saw the masters’
wives as a body in the College Chapel every Sunday morning.
Another matter on which he was outspoken was his repulsion
for George Eliot—not her works, but her personality. He once
said to me that her head reminded him of a horse’s, and on
another occasion said that no woman’s face had ever struck
him as more sensual.</p>

<p class='c016'>His own personality was splendid. He was so genial,
though such a fighter; he was so splendidly full of energy,
so quick to catch on to ideas, so masterful and wide-grasping
in carrying them out; so absolutely friendly; such a good
enemy, and so astonishingly warm-hearted. I never had a
greater personal feeling of respect and affection for any great
man than for Besant.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>All the world knows how much he effected for authors,
and how much he sacrificed for them. He made as large an
income as any great novelist of his time, but he might have
made much more and lived another twenty years, if he had
not slaved for his brother authors.</p>

<p class='c016'>George Meredith, who succeeded him as head of the literary
craft, was never at Addison Mansions, though his daughter
came twice with Lady Palmer. I only had the privilege
of knowing him towards the end of his life, when his time
and his health were far too precious to be spent on going to
at-homes, though he was very kind about having younger
authors introduced to him at the parties which Lady Palmer
gave in his honour when he was staying with her. Once
seen, George Meredith could never be forgotten. You were
delighted to find that a man who had created a literature
within a literature, the writer who by common acclaim is
the greatest of all English novelists, was so rare and impressive
in his appearance and speech. His face was singularly
beautiful in its old age, surmounted by a fleece of snow-white
hair, and illuminated by bright blue eyes, absolutely clear.
He was, of course, an excellent talker, and both his voice
and his way of using it were strikingly emphatic. There
are few old men whom I have met to whom I should so
unhesitatingly apply the word majestic. The whole face,
with its well-trimmed beard and unexaggerated features,
reminded me of the bearded Zeus in the group of the three
gods on the frieze of the Parthenon.</p>

<p class='c016'>He was very gracious also to young authors, though it
must have been a severe tax on him to have so many worshippers
introduced to him. For George Meredith was not
a man like Oliver Wendell Holmes. A lady whom I introduced
to him began, “It must bore you terribly, Dr. Holmes,
to have everybody who is introduced to you telling you how
they admire your books.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“On the contrary, madame,” he said gallantly, “I can
never get enough of it. I am the vainest man alive.”</p>

<p class='c016'>On the same occasion Holmes told me that he had been
unable to do any writing (except his short <i>Hundred Days in
Europe</i>) for years, because his entire time was taken up with
answering complimentary letters.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>Hardy did come to 32 Addison Mansions, Hardy who
has received the Order of Merit, and is proposed for next
year’s Nobel prize for literature, as the head of the literary
craft, one of the great masters of English fiction. I am very
proud to have known Thomas Hardy; he is not only so great,
but so silent and reserved, that it is not easy to know him.
I have met him often, but seldom seen him talking, except
very quietly to an intimate friend. He has generally been
on the edge of a crowd, observing—we have the fruits of that
profound observation in his novels. That slight figure,
that melancholy face, with the watchful eyes, was always
a cynosure, for Hardy has been the object of unbounded
admiration for many years. I remember his being the bright
particular star about whom the late Lady Portsmouth was
always talking at her house-parties at Eggesford, where I
stayed, as far back as 1885.</p>

<p class='c016'>I have a letter from him which is one of my most treasured
literary possessions. He wrote it to me to explain his point
in introducing the passage about the slaughtered pig after
I had reviewed <i>Jude, the Obscure</i>, at considerable length and
with minute criticism in the <i>Queen</i>. I have alluded to his
almost equal eminence as a poet in another chapter.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is natural to couple Hall Caine with Thomas Hardy, for
both of them were brought up as architects, though they
turned to literature, and reached the topmost rung.</p>

<p class='c016'>Hall Caine has been an intimate friend of mine for many
years. Our friendship began before he was a novelist, in
the days when he was a critic of the <i>Athenæum</i> and the
<i>Academy</i>, and an editor of poetry. His sending me <i>The
Sonnets of Three Centuries</i> in the year in which he lost
his housemate, the poet and artist, Dante Rossetti, was the
beginning of our friendship. He began publishing novels in
1885, and two years later leapt into the front rank of novelists
with his magnificent <i>Deemster</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>After my return from America I began to see more and
more of him. He became a director of the Authors’ Club,
of which I was Honorary Secretary, and one of the chief
speakers at the New Vagabonds Club.</p>

<p class='c016'>In 1894 he reached, with <i>The Manxman</i>, the height of fame,
at which he has since continued. I prophesied its enormous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>success in a long review of it, which I wrote for the <i>Queen</i>,
which came out simultaneously with the publication of the
book. We were in Rome together at the time that he was
writing the <i>Eternal City</i>, and in Egypt together while he was
writing <i>The White Prophet</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>No one could be in the presence of Hall Caine for five
minutes without knowing that he was in the presence of a
remarkable man. His resemblance to Shakespeare is extraordinary,
not only in the dome-like expanse of his forehead
and the Elizabethan slope of his beard, but in the burning
eyes and the shape of the eyecups. He looks the genius
that he is.</p>

<p class='c016'>Hall Caine has always had the merit of being highly
approachable and affectionate, and if his conversation is
apt to centre round the work he is doing, it is always most
interesting and pregnant.</p>

<p class='c016'>At Rome, for instance, where I very often had lunch with
him in his flat at Trinità del Monte, overlooking the city,
and went for walks with him, he was very full of the Vatican,
where he constantly went to see certain cardinals, who were
most indiscreet in their confidences.</p>

<p class='c016'>He was intimate with the Italian Government, too. I
met various members of the Cabinet at his table, and one of
them, Ferraris, then Postmaster-General, as well as editor
of the <i>Antologia Nuova</i>, has done me many acts of friendship
since.</p>

<p class='c016'>Jerome’s neighbour in those days, Joseph Hatton (than
whom there could have been no more striking contrast to
him), was one of his and my dearest friends. There were
few men so dear to their friends as Joe Hatton. He had an
enormous circle of them in literature, and on the stage, and
so won their hearts with his geniality and loyalty that they
forgot how eminent he was, and treated him as a brother.
But Joe Hatton, in addition to the vast amount of work he
did as editor and critic, wrote some of the best novels of his
day. I can see him now as he so often came to our house,
a rather small man with a brown beard, a lift of the chin,
a ready smile, and such very bright sympathetic brown eyes.
He used to bring his pretty little daughter with him before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>she was grown up. How proud he was of her first successes
on the stage, and the fairy-book she wrote! He had a house
with a very nice garden in St. John’s Wood, where he gave
parties at which one met all the leading actors and actresses
of the day. They could always spare time for a reception
at Hatton’s, as actors always stopped for a word with him
at the Garrick Club on Saturday nights.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of Doyle, Kipling and Barrie, Anthony Hope and Frankfort
Moore, I have spoken in another chapter.</p>

<p class='c016'>Stanley Weyman was such a rare visitor to London that
he was not often at our house. But I have corresponded
with him a good deal. I knew when I made <i>A Gentleman of
France</i> my book of the week in <i>To-day</i>, and hailed the author
as an historical novelist of the first rank, on what a solid basis
his work rested, for we were at Oxford at the same time,
and he took his First in History almost in the same term as
I took mine. He is a very fair man, with an eyeglass, much
more like a soldier than an author.</p>

<p class='c016'>Poor Crockett, a big tall man, with a fair beard, the type
of the Saxons who fought against the Conqueror at Hastings,
was not very often in London, but when he was there, he
was a conspicuous figure at our at-homes. We had many
tastes in common, including Italy. Crockett asked my
advice when the question arose of his giving up the ministry.
He was at that time Free Church minister of Penicuik, a
little place in Midlothian, with a salary, as far as I remember,
of a hundred or two a year, but as an author was making
a thousand or two a year, and able to earn a good deal more
if he could save the time which he had to devote to his clerical
work. His congregation were aghast at the idea of losing
their beloved minister just as he had sprung into Anglo-Saxon
fame, and, with Scottish casuistry, represented to
him that it would be wrong for him to neglect the work
of the Lord for any worldly object. Crockett thought, and I
agreed with him, and decided him, that he would be more
certain of doing good if he allowed some man to whom the
minister’s stipend was necessary to be minister of Penicuik,
while he did his teaching and his preaching with his pen.</p>

<p class='c016'>F. W. Robinson’s short, thick-set figure, and heavy moustache,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>were as conspicuous. It is strange how soon poor
Robinson has been forgotten. His work was popular with
readers, and treated with respect by critics, and he was one
of the bigwigs at literary clubs and receptions, but with his
death all memory of him seemed to pass away, except among
his old friends.</p>

<p class='c016'>G. A. Henty, on the other hand, though he has been dead
for years now, seems to stand before us still, with his great
beard, his great pipe, his great body, and his breezy personality.
Henty loved clubs and literary gatherings. The
Savage was his particular stronghold, when he had said
good-bye to war-correspondenting in distant lands. He was
the typical chairman there, with his Father Christmas beard,
and his volumes of smoke, and his bluff personality. He
had been as popular among his fellow-correspondents. Was
it not Henty who lost his only pair of boots, when the British
army marched into some capital (I think it was King Theodore’s
in Abyssinia), and took his place in the triumph in
carpet slippers, riding on a pony?</p>

<p class='c016'>Henty’s work as a war-correspondent gave him the copy
for those wonderful books which made him the boys’ Dumas.
He was a great personality, and, as I saw, on the only two
occasions when I ran across him in a crisis, a born ruler of
men.</p>

<p class='c016'>He often came across from his house on Clapham Common
to our at-homes, and looked like a strayed Viking, or a master-mariner,
among the other authors and authoresses. Sailing
was his hobby.</p>

<p class='c016'>Speaking of Abyssinia, it is natural to me to mention
Prince Alamayu—Ali, as we used to call him. He was sent
to Cheltenham College, so that he might live in the house of
Jex-Blake, then Principal of Cheltenham, and afterwards
head master of Rugby and Dean of Wells. Of all the head
masters of his time, Jex-Blake had the most considerable
reputation as a courtier and a man of the world. Alamayu
was brought to England after the capture of Magdala, and
came to Cheltenham in 1872, when he was eleven years old.
He was just a royal savage when he came to Cheltenham;
if he was hot, he took his coat off and threw it on the ground,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>and left it. He had no tutor to go about with him; he just
mixed with the boys in the ordinary way. And at first he
had the cruelties of his bringing-up; he once, for instance,
pushed a small boy into the water to see the splash he would
make. But he soon got cured of this, for Jex-Blake wisely
left him to fight his own battles, and though a sense of chivalry
made the boys very indulgent to the poor little orphaned
black, they soon let him know that bullying was not to be
one of his privileges, though almost anything else was treated
as a joke.</p>

<p class='c016'>When Jex-Blake went to Rugby, Alamayu went with him,
and thence, when he was eighteen, he went to Sandhurst to
qualify for the British Army. That was fatal. He was his
own master there, with no one to make him take care of his
health, or restrain himself in taking spirits. He soon contracted
some deadly disease—pneumonia, I think—and died.
Queen Victoria showed her regret by having him buried in
St. George’s Chapel at Windsor.</p>

<p class='c016'>I knew him very well, because I was in the head form
when he came to the school, and was often at Jex-Blake’s
house, and was asked by “Jex” to keep an eye on him.
He was a nice little boy, with a very affectionate disposition,
and not at all stupid. It was his misfortune to lose at a
critical moment of his life the firm and tactful hand which
had disciplined and protected him for seven years.</p>

<p class='c016'>Green Chartreuse is almost as deadly as aeroplanes. I
knew a man, a very well-known man, who went mad because
he drank thirty-six green Chartreuses in one day.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is natural to mention George Manville Fenn in the
same breath as Henty. He was another old friend of mine,
and of all the men I have known, retained his youth the
longest. Fenn’s hair remained golden and undiminished in
its vigour, and his figure remained slim and upright till he
was nearly seventy. He lived at the beautiful old red-brick
house on the river at Isleworth, which stands at the gates
of the Duke of Northumberland’s park, and is known as
Syon Lodge. There he turned out those wonderful boys’
romances of his in a steady stream. Like Henty, I met him
constantly at the Savage and Vagabond Clubs, and at my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>own flat. He was very fond of meeting his fellow-craftsmen.
His son, Fred Fenn, used to come too. At that time he was
sub-editor of the <i>Graphic</i>, and I think he afterwards became
first editor of the <i>Golden Penny</i>. In any case, he freed himself
from the fetters of journalism by writing <i>Amasis</i>, that
admirable Egyptian comic opera, in which Ruth Vincent
won all hearts. He not only had the cleverness to write
it, but formed the company which put it on, and stood an
action at law about it triumphantly—a rare instance of grit.</p>

<p class='c016'>Richard Jefferies never came to see me at Addison Mansions;
he was dead, I think, before we went there. But I have a
long and pathetic letter which he wrote to me some time
before he died, setting forth the cross-fire of diseases from
which he was suffering, and asking me if I thought the
climate of the exquisite Blue Mountains of New South Wales
would afford him any relief. One can picture how the genius
of Jefferies would have blossomed forth amid that matchless
gorge scenery (where you hear the bell-birds calling) and
amid the natural history curiosities of a new land.</p>

<p class='c016'>Grant Allen, who lived in a charming house in the Haslemere
district, was a constant visitor to our flat. We had
visited his people in Canada before we met him. His
father was the principal inhabitant at Kingston, Ontario,
the dear old-fashioned town which contains Canada’s Military
Academy. The old Allen had a fine house with a delightful
garden, right on Lake Ontario. Grant Allen was a remarkable-looking
man, with his long red beard, and keen, hawk-like
face. He always reminded me of the gaunt, red-bearded
faces one sees on knights and lovers in the great French
tapestries of the fifteenth century. And he had the same
spare figure as they have, and the same habit of arching his
back. He was a remarkable man, who, famous as he was,
never got his due as a writer. He was never an F.R.S.,
though half the Fellows of the Royal Society were his inferiors
in scientific attainments, and he never reached eminence as
a novelist, though he wrote some amazingly clever and
powerful books. He had a great contempt for actresses on
account of their want of conversation. He said they could
not talk about anything but the stage. I once came away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>with him from a party at H. D. Traill’s, where he had taken
down to supper a woman who was beyond dispute the
greatest actress of her time. He was complaining loudly
about it; he said that he thought she was the most stupid
woman he had ever met.</p>

<p class='c016'>But he was happy in his friendships. His brother-in-law,
Franklin Richards, father of the publisher, Grant Richards,
was recognised as one of the soundest philosophers of his
day at Oxford—I say this though his lectures were entirely
thrown away on me. I had to attend them because he was
a don of my College, but Philosophy was Chinese to me.</p>

<p class='c016'>One of Grant Allen’s greatest friends in the last part of
his life was Richard le Gallienne, who went to live in that
house in the wood beyond Haslemere to be near him. Le
Gallienne had a sort of summer-house in the wood, a long
way from the house, in which he wrote those charming poems,
secure from interruption. I often went to see him in the
days when he lived in the King’s Farm at Brentford, which
was not a very farm-like house. But I only once went to
see him at Haslemere, and on that occasion I found him at
the summer-house, dressed as carefully as if he had been in
town, but with an eye on country effects. He had on a black
velvet coat and waistcoat, and a rich black evening tie, but
immaculate white flannel trousers; and I must admit that
even in this costume he managed to look appropriate.</p>

<p class='c016'>When we were living at Cherwell Lodge, Oxford, that
delightful marine villa across the Cherwell from the Gothic
part of Magdalen, Grant Allen brought his best friend to
see us, Edward Clodd, the secretary of the London Joint
Stock Bank, who, in the intervals of a business career, had
written a number of great books, beginning with <i>The Childhood
of the World</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>W. D. Howells only came once to see us at Addison
Mansions, but I saw more of him when I was living in New
York, when he used to come in at tea-time to that little hall-room
we had for a sitting-room in that boarding-house in
West Forty-second Street. It gave me pleasure to see him
under my own roof, because I remembered how eagerly I
bought and read his novels when I was at Oxford, and David
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>Douglas was bringing out <i>A Chance Acquaintance</i>, <i>Their
Wedding Journey</i>, and so on, in the dainty little shilling paper
volumes which were the fortunate precursors of the modern
sevenpenny. Howells was rather a stout, bull-necked man,
very capable-looking, and in those days had a thick mop
of grey hair. In after years we knew his Italian books,
written while he was a Consul in Italy, almost by heart.
They are photographic in their fidelity.</p>

<p class='c016'>George W. Cable was another American who came to the
flat but once. Like Howells, he seldom honoured England
with a visit. His books, and John Burroughs’, too, I first
knew in the little David Douglas Library, and I well remember
reading his <i>Old Creole Days</i> all night, because I was so
fascinated with it.</p>

<p class='c016'>I was staying at the house of my sister’s father-in-law, the
Court Lodge at Yalding, at the time, and the month was
June—I had just come down from Oxford. At some impossibly
early hour—midnight seemed only just to have
slipped past—the dawn streamed in, and made me blow my
candle out, and the birds began their comment on the peach
garden. Five-and-thirty or forty years have passed since
then, but the delight of Cable’s poetical touch remains still
in my memory. Cable always rather reminded me of Hardy,
though being a Southerner from New Orleans he is darker
skinned. When he wrote <i>Old Creole Days</i>, he was the idol
of the South, but later, when he took up the colour question
on the other side, he would have been torn to pieces by the
mob of New Orleans if they had got hold of him, so he took
up his residence in Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c016'>I always slept in the haunted room in that house, a very
old house, with a kitchen and vaulted cellars going back to
the time of Edward III. It contained a very large cupboard,
between the old-fashioned chimney-piece and the window,
in which somebody is supposed to have been bludgeoned to
death, the corpse afterwards being dragged across the floor,
and when the window had been thrown up with a bang,
flung on the flags below. At one particular season of the
year, the noises which indicate this procedure plainly have
been heard by various people. I have forgotten when it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>happened, but it must have been a very long time ago, for
everything to have been done so openly.</p>

<p class='c016'>I have slept in that room repeatedly, alone, and never
heard the noises or thought about it being haunted, but I
should not like to sleep in the kitchen, for it was only separated
by a moth-eaten sort of door from the wickedest-looking
cellars I ever remember, which, unless something has been
done to them since then, lose themselves in pitch-dark
spaces.</p>

<p class='c016'>Another author, whose delightful essays on nature used
to be brought out in those dear little volumes of David
Douglas’s, and whom I read with even more enthusiasm
in those days, was John Burroughs, whom I visited in his
home at West Park, on a broad reach of the Hudson. He
told me that he wrote most of those essays when he was a
clerk in the Treasury at Washington, where his duties were
to sit opposite the safes, and see that no improper person
had access to them. I have forgotten what safes, but I
suppose they were those which contained the United States
gold reserve. He used to project the scenes in <i>Wake Robin</i>
and <i>Pepacton</i> on the blank doors of the safes in his mind,
as the cinema projects dissolving views on the lecturer’s
sheet. The sedentariness of this pursuit gave him acute
indigestion, and he was advised that nothing but manual
labour and a vegetable diet would cure it. When I was
with him, I think he lived entirely on asparagus, lentils
and onions. He could eat about three pounds of asparagus
at a sitting, as I suppose other people could if they weren’t
going to have any meat or pudding. He told me one thing
which filled my soul with joy. As manual labour was part
of the cure, he started a vineyard, in a position chosen with
great care, on a steep sloping bank of the Hudson facing due
south. His grapes ripened here three or four weeks before
any one else’s, with the result that he got a hundred pounds
a ton for them instead of four pounds. Bravo, literature!</p>

<p class='c016'>Henry James, in virtue of his long sojourn among us, belongs
to England almost as much as he does to America. He still
lives in London in the winter, but in the warm part of the
year he retires to a delightful Georgian house on the crest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>of the hill at Rye, one of the most old-world places in England.
Henry James’s house and garden are exactly what you would
choose for him—the most refined and dignified and subtle
novelist in the language. The house is called “Lamb’s
House,” but it has nothing to do with Charles Lamb, though
it is exactly the house which he would have chosen, when
fortune came to him. All the garden is adorable, but especially
the Dutch court behind the house, and the kitchen-garden,
surrounded by the most ancient cottages in Rye, with roofs
red and chimneys bewitched. Between the garden and the
kitchen-garden is a red-brick Georgian pavilion, facing the
top of the street, as the Tempietto faces the long sloping lane
which leads up to the Sculpture Gallery of the Vatican, and
it is not less beautiful than the Tempietto.</p>

<p class='c016'>Everything is appropriate; the novelist even bought the
cottages at the back of the kitchen-garden, to prevent them
being rebuilt, and thus ensured the permanence of a perfect
setting. He has a singularly noble head and face, the type
one would like to imagine for a Cicero.</p>

<p class='c016'>Richard Whiteing, who leapt into fame at a comparatively
late age, with <i>No. 5, John Street</i>, after having been one
of the most important newspaper writers in England for
many years, is another man whom you would pick out in
any crowd for his splendid head.</p>

<p class='c016'>Sir Gilbert Parker, who was a regular habitué of our at-homes
before he went into Parliament and became such an
overworked man, was in those days a slim, black-bearded
Colonial, with noticeable blue eyes. He was born in Canada,
the son of a British officer stationed out there, and knew
Australia as well as Canada—in fact, I met him because we
had both been in Australia. He was at that time a busy
journalist and in the first flush of his success as a novelist,
and no one could have deserved it better, for his novels had
the historical fidelity and felicity of Francis Parkman, in
addition to their graceful and romantic style. In spite of
the solid work he has done in politics, he will be remembered
as an author more than as a politician, though now we clap
him on the back for the splendid spade-work he does for the
Conservative Party. As a writer he fires the imagination,
like the bugles in his famous story.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>Henniker-Heaton, on the other hand, will be remembered
not for his biographical dictionary of Australians, which was
the precursor of <i>Who’s Who</i>, but for his achievement in politics—a
postal reform as far reaching as that of Rowland Hill,
the father of the post-office. I prophesied his success in print
nearly thirty years ago. He is a shining example of what
a man who has a great ideal can do by singleness of vision;
nothing could shake him from his ideal of a universal penny
post; ridicule was poured on it; the big battalions were brought
up against it; but he pursued it doggedly. He showed infinite
patience, infinite good-nature, infinite tact. He brought his
personal influence to bear on politicians of both sides. He
went to conferences all over the world; he entertained
delegates from all parts of the world; he collected and classified
every species of statistic; he accumulated irresistible facts
until he had a penny postage, not universal, because it does
not bridge the twenty miles between Kent and France,<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c011'><sup>[8]</sup></a> but
universal for the possessions of the Anglo-Saxon nations, for
the United States came into the agreement as well as the
Empire. Nor did his activities stop at the post-office; for
he has achieved reforms of almost equal magnitude in telegraphic
charges. Now he is taking a well-deserved rest, and
I cannot help thinking that he would take it very usefully
if he had a flat in Berlin, and saw the Kaiser every day. A
monarch of the force and intelligence of the Kaiser could not
help seeing the irresistibleness of the argument that a letter
ought to be taken from London to Hamburg and Berlin for
the same price as it is taken to the heart of British Borneo,
and if he once happened to notice it, he would brush away
the cobwebs which impede it.</p>

<p class='c016'>To Alfred Austin I was never attracted, except by his
enthusiasm for gardens and Italy. He was made Laureate
because he was a leader writer, not because he was a poet,
and possessed neither the ability nor the affability for the
post. Had he gone on writing about blackthorn and blackbirds,
he would have left a greater name as a poet, and would
not have been made the victim of the famous story which is
told of a Scottish law lord, who, meeting him at a country
house, said, “Well, Mr. Austin, are you still writing ‘pomes’?”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>“One must do something to keep the wolf from the door,”
replied the poet, with official modesty.</p>

<p class='c016'>“And is that what you use those ‘pomes’ for?” asked
the man of law, giving one visions of a small man with a
big moustache belabouring a wolf on the door-step with a
roll of manuscript.</p>

<p class='c016'>I know of only one more malicious story, which relates to
the bestowal of a bishopric. While it was in the balance,
Lord Salisbury was suffering from one of his fits of insomnia,
and, as his custom was, sent for an M.P. son, whose speeches
were the only thing which could make him sleep. His son
bothered him all night to bestow the see—it was the premier
bishopric—on its present holder. At last Lord Salisbury
lost patience. “Oh! give it to him, and leave me. I
prefer insomnia.”</p>

<p class='c016'>It was <i>à propos</i> of insomnia that Lord Salisbury made his
finest retort in the House of Lords. A new Liberal peer, to
whom the leader was particularly acid, because, having been
a whip in the House of Commons, he was rather conscious of
his importance, was, in spite of the fact that his income arose
chiefly from a brewery, advocating Local Option, because he
said that the number of public-houses was a temptation to
drink. “Of course,” said Lord Salisbury, “I do not enjoy
the same opportunities as the noble Lord does for knowing
the effect of the number of public-houses upon the amount
which is drunk, but I don’t see his line of argument, because,
though I live in a house with forty bedrooms, I never feel
the slightest inclination to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The Irish Party, too, came in for his acid wit. Who has
forgotten his comment on the member of the Irish Party
who libelled him, and went to America, when he lost the action,
to escape paying the costs? Lord Salisbury only shrugged
his shoulders, and said that escaping was the <i>forte</i> of the
Irish, adding, “Some prefer the fire-escape, and some the
water-escape.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Harold Frederic owed some of his vogue as a novelist in
this country to Mr. Gladstone, who had an immense enthusiasm
for his great novel, <i>In the Valley</i>. Frederic, a big burly man,
with a burly moustache, was the ablest American journalist
in London, till the advent of Isaac Nelson Ford for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span><i>Tribune</i>, and Harry Chamberlain for the <i>Sun</i> and the Laffan
Agency. Frederic represented the <i>New York Times</i>. He
was a man coarse in his speech, and rather coarse in his fibre,
and full of prejudices, but he had the gift of political prophecy,
and, like Balaam, his utterances were dictated by
the voice within him, and not by what he had come to say.
His letters to his paper were splendid journalism. He used
often to come to Addison Mansions, because he lived just
round the corner in the old house on Brook Green. He
might have been with us now, if he had not been a Christian
Scientist. He was an enormous consumer of alcohol, though
I never knew him the worse for liquor, and when he was
taken with his last illness, the professor of Christian Science,
who was called in by a woman who had great influence over
him, was not able to insist upon banishing spirits as a regular
practitioner would have done. The result was that he took
stimulants (which were worse than poison to him) whenever
he felt bad, and ruined his chance of recovery.</p>

<p class='c016'>Rider Haggard I have spoken of elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c016'>Frank Hopkinson Smith is a man I should have liked to
see more of at Addison Mansions; he was one of the men I
liked best among my friends in American literary clubs.
He was an engineer by profession, who had carried out many
important contracts. Writing, though he was one of the
best writers in America, was an afterthought with him.
Like Du Maurier, that delightful man and delightful writer,
he stumbled upon his most brilliant gift.</p>

<p class='c016'>Du Maurier became a novelist because he had become such
a master of situation and polished dialogue in his pictures
and their titles. Frank Hopkinson Smith grew to be a
novelist out of the anecdotes which he told so brilliantly at
story-tellers’ nights at the Century Club. He had a fund of
stories about the Italian labour which he employed in contracts.
He always used to declare that engaging Italian
labour was as simple as Kodaking, which had for its motto,
“You press a button—we do the rest.” He said that no
matter how many men he needed, all he had to do was to
ring up an Italian boss the night before, and tell him that he
wanted so many men for a certain kind of job. Then they
would be at any station in the city at seven o’clock the next
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>morning, with the proper tools. He added that he always
put a clause into the contract that if any of them murdered
each other, the number was to be made up at once.</p>

<p class='c016'>“That is their weakness,” he said, “but they only practice
it on each other. It’s the only kind of labour I would undertake
a contract with. They’re better than the Irish, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I don’t agree with you,” said Vermont, the sculptor;
“they’re so cruel.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Cruel!” retorted Hopkinson Smith. “What price this?
An Irishman named Larkin hired an organ-monkey from
an old Dago for a dollar a day. The monkey was often
badly bruised when he came back at night, and looked
frightened to death when Larkin came to fetch him in the
morning. So one Saint’s day when the old Dago had a
holiday, he determined to follow them up and watch them.
The Irishman drove along till he came to the bridge over the
railway at the bottom of Twelfth Avenue, where the coal
carts all pass on their way up from the depot. Then he took
the monkey out of the cart, and tied him to a post ten or
twenty yards away from the bridge, but in full sight of it.
Then he drove his horse and cart to a convenient place a little
way off, and awaited events.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Presently the coal carts began to stream across the
bridge, and the monkey in terror ran up to the top of the
post. The whole way across every carter took cock-shots
at it with pieces of coal. Occasionally one hit it, and then
the monkey screamed with rage and pain. As soon as there
was a cart load of coal lying at the foot of the post, Larkin
brought up his horse and cart and shovelled them in, first
putting the monkey where he could not be seen, to show that
the sport was over for the present. When he was loaded up,
he hitched the monkey to the cart again, and drove into New
York to the retailer who bought the coal from him.</p>

<p class='c016'>“But the next morning, when he came for the monkey,
he found not only that monkey, but every monkey in the organ-grinders’
quarter, gone, and when he got down to the bridge,
the place was looking like a zoo.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Suddenly the popular anecdote-teller wrote <i>Colonel Carter of
Cartersville</i>, one of the best American novels of its generation.</p>

<p class='c016'>William de Morgan, the other novelist who achieved his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>first book success so late in life, was never at Addison Mansions,
but I had the honour of meeting him at a much more interesting
place—the little <i>atelier</i>, somewhere in the Kilburn
district, where he made the famous lustre tiles by which he
was known before he took to literature. George Joy, the
artist who painted the famous picture of Gordon meeting
his death at Khartum, took me to see De Morgan, knowing
how enthusiastic I was over the famous Mazzara Vase, and
the other pieces preserved in Sicily of the old Sicilian Arab
lustre ware.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of Bret Harte and Maarten Maartens I have spoken
elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c016'>Egerton Castle, whose <i>Young April</i> is the most delightful
book of the romantic school, in which Anthony Hope, Henry
Harland, and a few others have written with such charm,
was a rare visitor. Any one could see that he had been a
soldier. But the militariness of his active, upright figure is
no doubt partly due to the fact that he is one of the finest
fencers in the country. He has been a representative of
England in the international contests. He is likewise, as
his books show, a notable connoisseur, and he has ample
means to indulge his tastes, not only from the wide popularity
of the novels which he writes, mostly in collaboration with
his wife, but from his having owned one of the chief daily
newspapers, the <i>Liverpool Mercury</i>, which is now amalgamated
with the <i>Liverpool Post</i>. The Agnes Castle who
collaborates with him is, of course, his wife, not his sister.</p>

<p class='c016'>Percy White was a constant visitor. He has been my
intimate friend since he published his first novel, <i>Mr. Bailey
Martin</i>, that merciless dissection of suburban snobbery. I
used to write for him when he edited <i>Public Opinion</i>, and
that was a long time ago. He was one of the handsomest
men in literature, with his merry, boyish face, dark eyes,
and bright golden hair. C. B. Fry, the greatest all-round
athlete in the records of sport, is his nephew, and, though
darker, reminds me very much of Percy White as he was.
Florence White, who paints portraits, is his sister.</p>

<p class='c016'>Percy White’s books have never met with the circulation
they deserve. If he had been born an American, they might
have had the largest circulation in the world. He is just the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>writer whose circulation would have spread like wildfire, if
he had lived in America, and written of American social life
as he has written of ours. No one could have expressed the
good and the bad in the American character with the same
light touch and ruthless penetration. His is just the pen to
depict the iron courage and the insight of genius which,
with or without chicanery, lead to the amassing of millions—the
selfishness, made endurable by grit and personal charm,
of the American woman—the brilliant wit and pathetic lack
of humour in Americans as a nation—the business side of
sport.</p>

<p class='c016'>Once upon a time I introduced him to a man whom I will
call the Vidler, who ran a newspaper, and never paid anybody
anything except by advertisements in that paper. He
made periodical business journeys, collecting advertisements
for his paper—my heart bled for the advertisers—and
used to engage an editor to look after his paper while he was
away. He chose Percy White for the honour on this occasion,
and asked me if I could bring them together. I gave White his
message, warning him that he would only be paid in promises,
and was surprised to hear that he was willing to discuss the
matter with the Vidler. The Vidler gave him a wonderful
dinner at the Carlton, probably not paid for yet, and then
took him back to his chambers to discuss the matter in hand.
White sat up with him nearly all night, gravely taking down
notes of his projects for the paper, but reserved his decision,
which resulted in a negative. I met him the next day, and
asked him how he had got on, and when I heard how late he
had been kept, apologised for all the trouble to which I had
put him, knowing how little chance there was of his getting
any pecuniary advantage out of it.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Don’t apologise, my dear Douglas,” he said; “I got a
whole book out of him. He’s the finest study I ever met in
my life.”</p>

<p class='c016'>As Percy White did not take up the appointment, I set
myself to find a man who was willing to take the post, and
would not suffer for it. I found a man who was as sharp a
diamond as the Vidler himself. He was duly engaged, and
I always wondered which did the other in the eye. I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>my suspicions, because when I met the Vidler a year or two
afterwards at Monte Carlo, he did not allude to the finish.</p>

<p class='c016'>George Gissing did not come often, though we had the
great link of both knowing and loving the Ionian Sea.</p>

<p class='c016'>If Gissing had not died, and there was no reason why he
should have died if he had taken ordinary care of himself—he
would only be fifty-six if he were alive now—he would
have had a reputation like Barrie or Bernard Shaw by this
time, for even during his lifetime people were just beginning
to wake up to the extraordinary qualities of his writing. I
am not comparing him to either of those two; I only make
the comparison because everything pointed to his having
popularity. Every now and then some excellent writer
achieves popularity. No one knows why. His excellence
is against his having a wide public, and it is very seldom
possible to tell why one is taken and another left. As the
Bible proverb says, “Two women shall be grinding at the
mill; one shall be taken and the other left.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Gissing had a genius for imparting romance to the sordid.</p>

<p class='c016'>W. J. Locke often came in those days. He was secretary
to the Royal Institute of British Architects, and combined
with it the post of literary adviser to John Lane, the publisher—a
collaboration which resulted in the publication of many
notable books, of which none were more eventually successful
than his own, except, I suppose, H. G. Wells’s, and I think
that it was he who advised Lane to bring out the works of
Wells, and Harland’s <i>The Cardinal’s Snuff-box</i>, and Kenneth
Grahame’s <i>Golden Age</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>Locke was always one of the most distinguished-looking
persons in a room, with his tall, slight figure, very well dressed,
and his hair—golden, with a natural wave in it—beautifully
valeted. His theatrical successes did not begin till much
later, nor had he developed his powers as a public speaker.
He published admirable and solidly successful books before
he took the reading world by storm with <i>The Beloved Vagabond</i>,
and his novels won the respect of his fellow-craftsmen
from the first. In those days he lived in a modest flat at
Chelsea, and was a pretty regular attendant at literary clubs
and receptions.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>Coulson Kernahan was one of the most prominent figures
in the set, because he had both a brilliant personality, and
was producing a remarkable series of books, beginning with
<i>A Dead Man’s Diary</i>. Coulson is one of our oldest and
most intimate literary friends. I met him again directly I came
back from America. He was at that time literary adviser
to Ward, Lock &amp; Co.</p>

<p class='c016'>When James Bowden split from his partners, Ward, Lock &amp;
Co., and started a publishing business of his own, Kernahan
went with him, and continued his profoundly imaginative
series with books about Heaven—long, thin volumes, longer
and thinner even than the John Oliver Hobbes booklets,
which Fisher Unwin was bringing out. They sold by the
hundred thousand. They were the literary topic of the day,
till Norma Lorimer in despair said, “Kernahan is growing
too chummy with his Creator.”</p>

<p class='c016'>In another line his imagination produced <i>Captain Shannon</i>,
a mysterious and thrilling adventure book. But he was
soon to find his <i>métier</i>, and leave thrilling fiction to Mrs.
Kernahan. He became a lecturer, for which his brilliant
personality, his eloquence, his gift of humour, and his conviction,
had cut him out. He went to live in the country;
he lectured; he became an officer in the Territorials. And
now he has turned them all to account in the service of the
Empire, to which he is so passionately devoted, by going
round as a caravan-lecturer to make the youth of the country
awake to the national peril from unpreparedness.</p>

<p class='c016'>At a National Defence meeting, last summer, at which
Kernahan was the chief speaker, with Rudyard Kipling in
the chair, Kernahan told his audience of his last good-bye
word with Captain Robert Scott.</p>

<p class='c016'>The hero of the South Pole asked him what he was doing,
and whether he had any new book on the stocks.</p>

<p class='c016'>“No,” was the reply; “I am neglecting my scribbling to
work for Lord Roberts and National Defence.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Good!” said Scott, with unwonted warmth and enthusiasm.
“Good! I’m with you there!”</p>

<p class='c016'>Speaking of Lord Roberts, the grand old soldier is very
appreciative of the work Kernahan is doing in this direction.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>The veteran Field Marshal not only wrote a eulogistic introduction
to the Territorial author’s book on soldiering, but
when the latter has been addressing great audiences on
National Defence, has on several occasions sent telegrams
to the chairman, asking that his thanks be conveyed to the
speaker, and warmly commending Kernahan’s patriotism
and the work he is doing for his country. Kernahan is almost
as widely known for his friendships as for his writings. He
has known intimately many distinguished men and women—authors,
actors, soldiers, artists, explorers and politicians.
On the walls of his library are many signed and inscribed
portraits of celebrities, as well as pictures inscribed to him
by the painters. On his shelves are numerous books dedicated
or inscribed to him by the writers. One takes up a volume
of Swinburne and finds written in it, “To Coulson Kernahan,
whom Swinburne dearly loved, and who as dearly loved him.
From his old and affectionate friend, Theodore Watts-Dunton.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Another bears the inscription, “With the kind regards of
Arthur James Balfour.” Yet another, “To Coulson Kernahan,
from his old chum, Jerome K. Jerome.”</p>

<p class='c016'>He is famous too, or I should say infamous, as “infamous”
is the only word to apply to it, for the illegibility of his handwriting.
His friend Harry de Windt, brother of the Ranee
of Sarawak, tells a good story of this. It is to the effect
that Kernahan once received a letter which ran as follows—</p>

<p class='c016'>“Dear Kernahan,—Many thanks for your letter. The parts
we could make out are splendid. We are using the rest as
a railway pass. No one can read enough of it to say that
it isn’t a railway pass, and as life is too short for any one to
find out what it really says, the collector has in the end to
let us through.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Of Horace Annesley Vachell, one of those whom the gods
love, well born, more than usually prepossessing in appearance
and disposition, a sportsman, and one of the best novelists
of the day, I saw a good deal when he first came back from
California, and brought me a letter of introduction, asking
me to help him to meet the literary people in London. I
was immensely attracted to him, as attracted to him as I
was to his books, for which he had a good foundation in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>variety of life which he had led. He started with Harrow
and the Rifle Brigade, and had been many things, from a
rancher in California to an artist, before he found his vocation
in literature. <i>The Hill</i>, his famous Harrow school novel,
increased his popularity wonderfully, but he was an admirable
writer from the first, both in story and style. I have heard
it stated that on one of his great books his publishers made
the sporting suggestion that he should receive no advance
on account of royalties, but a thirty per cent. royalty from
the beginning, and that he accepted the offer.</p>

<p class='c016'>When I wrote to Vachell to ask him what had made him
turn his attention to writing, he wrote back—</p>

<p class='c009'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Sladen</span>,</p>
<p class='c010'>“Bad times in California turned me to scribbling,
although I had written some short stories for the magazines.
I am rather proud of the fact that I burnt my first very long
novel on the advice of a friend, who said that he could find
a publisher for it, and yet urged cremation instead!”</p>

<p class='c025'>Vachell told me that one of the triumphs in his career which
he valued most was the winning of the half-mile race for Sandhurst
against Woolwich, which gave them the victory in the
Sports that year, 1881. Later he was asked to run against
Myers, the famous American, but wisely refused to do so.</p>

<p class='c016'>He told me an amusing story of the hundred-pound prize
which <i>T. P.’s Weekly</i> offered for the person who could discover
most mistakes, typographical and so forth, in one of his
novels, which he had been unable to revise himself. A parson
wrote to him most indignantly, saying that there were no
mistakes at all in the book, and that he was surprised that
Vachell should lend himself to a cheap dodge for advertising
a novel. He hinted that Vachell had obtained money from
him—he had bought a six-shilling copy—under false pretences!
Vachell in return sent him one announcement of
the result of the competition. The man who won the prize
discovered nearly <i>four hundred</i> errors! This sounds quite
incredible, but it is true, as a most lengthy document in his
possession proves. The knowledge of his works displayed by
the winner fairly confounded him.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>He had some strange personal experiences in California.
A big cowboy rushed out of a saloon in the West, one day,
followed by another cowboy brandishing a big six-shooter.
The first cowboy took refuge behind the only cover in sight,
a telegraph-post. He dodged round this, while the second
cowboy emptied his pistol into the post. All six bullets
were in the post! Afterwards, when he was chaffed by me
for missing his man, he retorted, “Boys, the son of a gun
shrunk!” Both cowboys were full of sheep-herder’s delight.</p>

<p class='c016'>And he told me another amusing Californian anecdote.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I met a pretty girl whom I had not seen for months.
She informed me that she was engaged to be married, and
when I asked for details, she replied, ‘He is not very rich
in this world’s goods, but in morals, Mr. Vachell, he’s a
millionaire.’ She married her moral millionaire, and about
a year later I met her again. She was alone. Remembering
her phrase, I said, ‘How is your moral millionaire?’ She
replied instantly, ‘He’s bust!’ I heard later that she had
just divorced him.”</p>

<p class='c016'>And a short while ago he sent me one of the best newspaper
bulls I remember, which appeared in the <i>Western Daily Press</i>
review of <i>Loot</i>, on Dec. 19, 1913.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Mr. Vachell, who is perhaps most widely known as the
author of one of the best modern stories of school life, <i>The
Hell</i>, in which Harrow is described,” etc.</p>

<p class='c016'>Another of those whom the gods love is A. E. W. Mason,
who met with success very early. Mason was a Dulwich
boy, and a Trinity, Oxford, man, and was on the stage before
he took to literature, to his permanent advantage, for it
gave him that practical acquaintance with stage-craft which
hastened his success as a dramatist.</p>

<p class='c016'>From the moment that he published <i>The Courtship of
Morrice Buckler</i> it was recognised that Mason was a romance-writer
with the charm of an Anthony Hope. And his
reputation has gone on increasing. <i>The Four Feathers</i> was
a book of genius. Unlike most authors, Mason has remained
a bachelor, consoling himself with yacht-sailing among the
Hebrides when he grows tired of social distractions and
politics. For some years he represented the important
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>constituency of Coventry in Parliament as a Liberal. And
he was one of the few Liberals who dared to be independent,
which is probably the reason why he gave up politics. He
was one of the most boyish-looking members in the House,
blue-eyed, clean-shaven, fresh-coloured and slim. He has
changed very little since he left Trinity. He is a charming
public speaker, and his boyishness is one of his great charms
in speaking. My friendship with Mason began on our first
visit to Salcombe, the little Devonshire town on the wooded
inlet which lies behind the Bolt Head. He had sailed into
the inlet in a small yacht, and came to see me as an old
Trinity man. Mason is one of the men who count.</p>

<p class='c016'>Max Pemberton has had many successes in his half-century
of life. Educated at Merchant Taylors, and Caius, Cambridge,
he nearly got into the Cambridge boat. He started his literary
life by editing one of the chief boys’ papers and writing
boys’ books—his <i>Iron Pirate</i> had a prodigious vogue among
future men. From this he soon passed to editing <i>Cassell’s
Magazine</i>, which occupied ten of his fifty years, and writing
novels, with their scenes laid in romantic and half-civilised
countries—what one might call “Balkan” novels. In these
he has hardly any rivals, because to an instinct for construction,
and skill in dialogue and description, he adds unusual
ingenuity in contriving plots and selecting subjects, and
accuracy in handling facts. Pemberton’s novels present most
vivid pictures of the far countries in which their scenes are laid.</p>

<p class='c016'>I met him first at the Savage Club; we were sitting next to
each other at dinner, and he introduced himself as the editor
of <i>Cassell’s Magazine</i>, and asked if I felt disposed to write
a series of Japanese stories for him—the stories which were
afterwards worked up to <i>When We were Lovers in Japan</i>
(<i>Playing the Game</i>). I was very much flattered by his
proposal, and from that day to this we have remained intimate
friends. This series was followed by the series of Sicilian
stories which were worked up into my novel, <i>Sicilian Lovers</i>.
In both series I was to give as much local colour as possible.</p>

<p class='c016'>After this we began to go to each other’s houses, and I well
remember the first time that we went to Pemberton’s, before
he had moved to Fitzjohn’s Avenue. It was a Sunday evening,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>and he had asked us to meet poor Fletcher Robinson,
who would have been one of the greatest journalists of the
day if he had survived. He was born to it, for he was a
nephew of old Sir John Robinson, who managed the <i>Daily
News</i> for many years. He was, at the time of his death,
assistant-editor of a great daily, and he was one of the persons
whose death was attributed to incurring the displeasure of
the celebrated Egyptian mummy in the British Museum.
He was a huge, fair man, with curly sandy hair; he was
beloved of society, and a poet as well as an editor.</p>

<p class='c016'>The popular account of his death is that, not believing in
the malignant powers of the celebrated mummy-case in the
British Museum, he determined to make a slashing attack on
the belief in the columns of the <i>Daily Express</i>, and went to
the museum, and sent his photographer there, to collect the
materials for that purpose: that he was then, although in
the most perfect health, struck down mysteriously by some
malady of which he died. The ancient Egyptians certainly
seem to have been able to protect the tombs and coffins
and bodies of their dead by active spiritual powers, which I
respect. But in any case, the adage of chivalry, <i>de mortuis
nil nisi bonum</i>, ought to prevent people from behaving unkindly
to anything that concerns the dead.</p>

<p class='c016'>We continued to see a good deal of the Pembertons till
Max took Troston Hall in Suffolk because he found that
London gaieties interfered with his work. But a few years
later he felt drawn back to London, and took chambers in
St. James’s, though he kept Troston on, and it was in those
chambers that he wrote one of his great successes, the revue
<i>Hallo Ragtime</i>—the best and most popular revue ever written.</p>

<p class='c016'>Unlike so many of our leading authors, Max Pemberton,
who is a distinguished-looking man—one would take him
for a diplomat—is as interesting to meet as his books are
to read. He shines in society.</p>

<p class='c016'>A mutual friend of us both is Robert Leighton. Mrs.
Leighton I have mentioned above. Leighton’s gifts are of
a serious editorial order, though he has written boys’ books
of wide popularity. The Leightons are among the most
popular figures at literary gatherings—they are so lovable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>that they have an immense circle of friends. Robert Leighton
is recognised as having no superior as a writer on dogs. They
have left their house in St. John’s Wood now and gone to
live in an old-world house at Lowestoft.</p>

<p class='c016'>When Arthur Morrison, who was already known as a
brilliant journalist, one of Henley’s most incisive young men,
made such a success with his <i>Tales of Mean Streets</i> and his
<i>Martin Hewitt</i> stories, one imagined that he would pour
out a stream of books like other writers who have “boomed.”
But he has been exceedingly moderate. We had a bond of
sympathy which used to bring him to our house. We had
a collection of very unusual Japanese curios of the humble
order, and he had one of the finest collections of Japanese
prints in the country. We never saw as much of him as
we wished because he lived in Essex, and when the success
of his books enabled him to do his work where he liked, he
grew more and more reluctant to come to London.</p>

<p class='c016'>Another man of that generation to whom we grew much
attached was Eden Phillpotts. In those days he was struggling
with ill-health and over-work. London did not agree
with him, and he had to write his novels in the intervals of
journalism. Though he told me that they seldom went out
elsewhere, he and his pretty wife were often at 32 Addison
Mansions. They lived at Bedford Park in those days. While
he was assistant editor of <i>Black and White</i>—that paper edited
by so many of our friends—it seemed to be a different one
every year, during its brief existence—he began to feel the
strain a good deal, and finally determined to burn his ships
and go back to his native Devon—he was a grandnephew of the
famous Bishop of Exeter—and depend entirely upon his novels.</p>

<p class='c016'>The experiment was a complete success. His health
improved in his native air, and directly he could give the
proper leisure to writing his novels, he sprang into almost
the first rank—alike for the extraordinary power of his stories,
for his intimate knowledge of Devonshire and Devonian
character, and for the individuality of his style. Phillpotts
never deteriorates. He is one of those men who carry the
stamp of intelligence and <i>simpatica</i> on their faces. Now he
is following in the footsteps of the other great novelists and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>getting a footing on the stage, where he will be well represented
this year.</p>

<p class='c016'>Robert Hichens is a very handsome and intellectual-looking
man—if his portrait had been executed by the steel
engravers of a hundred years ago it would have borne a
striking resemblance to the portraits of Lord Byron. He
has regular, clear-cut, refined features, of a very similar type.
I have not run across Hichens as often as might be expected
in Sicily and Egypt, though we have both been in these
countries, especially the former, so much. But I did meet
him one evening at Luxor, in the midst of one of those superb
Egyptian sunsets. He was on his <i>dahabea</i>, which he had
brought over from its usual anchorage near the bar on the
Thebes side. It was a luxurious and very Oriental-looking
<i>dahabea</i>. The saloon, separated from the cabins by heavy
Persian curtains, would have made a far more picturesque
scene for <i>Bella-Donna</i> on the stage than the steam-<i>dahabea</i>
which appeared in the actual play. He was living on one
of the old sailing-<i>dahabeas</i>, which are the most delightful to
occupy, though people generally do not sail up from Cairo
nowadays, but have them towed up to Luxor before they
join them, so as to have all their time in the picturesque,
temple-studded reach between Luxor and Assuan.</p>

<p class='c016'>That meeting is riveted in my mind, because Hichens, in
thanking me for a long and enthusiastic review which I had
written over my signature in the <i>Queen</i> about his <i>Garden of
Allah</i>, said that though I had spoken in such terms of the
book, and brought out all its good points, he had a conviction
that in my heart of hearts I felt a sort of repulsion for it,
which was true. I thought the heroine’s falling in love with
such a man at first, and her sending him back to his cell as
a monk afterwards, equally repellent; while I could not help
doing homage to the book, and revelling in its Eastern setting.</p>

<p class='c016'>Some time after my return to England I was nearly brought
into a very close relation with Hichens.</p>

<p class='c016'>One morning Sir George Alexander came post-haste to
call on me. I was not in. So at lunch a telegram as long as
a letter arrived—would I see him in the theatre after such
an act that night? The royal box was at my disposal if I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>cared to see the play. I telephoned my acceptance to
Helmsley—a good actor, but far too good a manager to be
spared to take a part—and wondered what was up. When
I got to the theatre, I discovered what I was wanted for.
Hichens’s <i>Bella-Donna</i> was coming on. All the preparations
were ready for his inspection, and Hichens could not be
found by telegram in Europe or Africa. Alexander asked
if I would superintend the staging. The fee fixed was a
liberal one. But I was in a quandary. I knew that neither
J. Bernard Fagan, who had dramatised the story, nor Alexander,
had ever been in Egypt, and that the play and its
mounting, however well done, must be full of slips, to which
I ought to object. About Alexander I was not disturbed,
for I knew that his only idea would be to get the thing right.
But with Fagan it might be different. He would doubtless
have been studying the subject fiercely, and I should have to
reckon with his <i>amour propre</i>, and probably lose a friend—who
had been at Trinity, Oxford, like myself—that delightful
Sheridan-like person and personality, so I gave rather a
modified consent. I suggested that fresh efforts should be
made to find Hichens, but promised that if finally he
could not be found I would take his place in correcting the
Egyptianities of the piece.</p>

<p class='c016'>Fortunately, at the last minute Hichens did turn up, and
I was saved from the responsibility. I was very grateful,
for when the first night came, and with it stalls for the
performance, there were many little points to which I should
have had to take exception, though they made no difference
to the enjoyment of such of the public as had not been in
Egypt. Still, I am sure that Fagan would have felt sore
about my correcting his scenes like a schoolboy’s Latin verses.
As it happened, Alexander and Mrs. Patrick Campbell were
so magnificent in their parts, and the piece was so splendidly
produced, that the public did not bother itself about small
details, but flocked to see the play. It could hardly have
been a greater success than it was for any improvements
that I could have suggested. I never saw Hichens at his
residence in Taormina—we never happened to be in the
Sicilian Eden at the same moment.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXII<br /> <br /><span class='c022'>MY NOVELIST FRIENDS: PART II</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>W. B. Maxwell</span> I hardly knew in those days, though I
had met him years before, and, in the long and elaborate
review which I wrote of his <i>Vivien</i>, had hailed him as
a novelist who would rise to the very head of his craft.</p>

<p class='c016'>Maxwell, of course, had heredity and atmosphere in his
favour. His mother, the famous Miss Braddon, had written
novels which took the world by storm long before he was
born—it is more than half a century ago since an astonishing
girl founded a new school of fiction with <i>Lady Audley’s
Secret</i> and <i>Aurora Floyd</i>—and he and his wife live with his
mother in a stately old Queen Anne mansion in the Sheen
Road at Richmond. Maxwell, who looks like a youthful
judge—he is clean-shaven, and has a calm, judicial face,
with an illuminating smile—has a judge’s gift of scrutiny
in reviewing life in his books. He is ruthlessly just with his
characters; they cannot deceive him. His sentences are not
too severe. But whatever their sentences are, the criminals
leave the court moral wrecks. He is obliged to mete out
just sentences, but he is ruthless in his summing up. His
last novel, <i>The Devil’s Garden</i>, is an excellent example of his
great impeachments of wrong. His books have the Até—the
Nemesis—tracking down their victims as ruthlessly as
the Œdipus is tracked down in the tragedies of ancient
Greece.</p>

<p class='c016'>Another writer whose novels I admire immensely, and I
have had to review a good many of them, is H. B. Marriott
Watson, the New Zealander. He has a large public, and,
in my opinion, ought to have a far larger one. As a writer
of novels of adventure, I think he has no superior among the
novelists of the day. For his adventures are most romantic,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>and his writing is so good—so delicate where it ought to be
delicate, so strong where it ought to be strong. Added to
which, he is scrupulous about getting his local colour and
“properties” correct. In appearance he is a typical colonist—a
huge man, with a dark, resolute face. When he first
became prominent in the literary world, you might have
thought that he was captain of the famous “All Black”
football team, rather than a writer. Apart from his success
as a novelist, he has been a power in journalism.</p>

<p class='c016'>Charles Garvice, whose novels have a greater circulation
than those of any other living writer, is now my neighbour.
We live exactly opposite each other, with the breadth of
Richmond Green between, with its old lawns, and tall elms
planted by dead kings. He lives in one of the Maids of
Honour houses, built a couple of centuries ago, abutting on
the wall of the Old Palace of the Tudors, in which Queen
Elizabeth died, and those Maids of Honour served. It has
some beautiful eighteenth-century painted panelling. I look
out on its mellow brickwork, pointed with white stone, and
the fantastic Georgian ironwork of its gate, half-buried in
a tangle of swaying roses, from my study windows, just as I
look out on the crenellated wall and old perpendicular
archway of King Henry VII’s palace on the other side of
the clipped yew and the great stone-pine.</p>

<p class='c016'>When I first knew Garvice, twenty years ago, he was
farming his own lands in Devonshire, and just beginning to
find his public on this side, though he had long enjoyed an
enormous public in America. He used to pay frequent
visits to the Authors’ Club, where, since he had rooms
in Whitehall Court, he was more of a habitué than many
men who lived in London, and became extremely popular
for his genuine good-fellowship. A few years ago, when the
Club was rather languishing, he became chairman of the
committee which undertook its reconstruction, and though
he had in the interval become one of the most popular and
hard-worked novelists of the day, lavished his time and
energies with happy results, so that now it has even more
members than the Athenæum, and far more than any other
literary club. He is the central figure at its great dinners.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>He wrote a delightful book about farming—not a literary
exercise, but as the outcome of many years’ practical work.
Garvice, undoubtedly, has the largest sale of any novelist
in the world. I have seen the figures. Last year’s sales
alone amounted to 1,750,000 copies—books of all prices.
His romantic love-stories are conspicuous not only for their
thrilling plots—Garvice is a born story-writer—but for their
freedom from all deleterious influence. There is nothing
goody-goody about them; they are just wholesome, straight-forward
romances—an almost lost art. He is only the
length of the Palace away from the river, where he keeps
a sailing-boat, and he is fond of riding in Richmond Park.
He needs recreations, for he is a very hard worker. Every
morning he goes up to his office in London, where he spends
the business day in dictating his novels, and he gives many
of his evenings up to the Authors’ Club, which, under his
chairmanship, and the tireless secretaryship of Algernon
Rose, has now a membership of 1,600. Garvice is a great
reader of his brother-authors’ books.</p>

<p class='c016'>Feeling that the public would like to know the secret of
one of the most remarkable literary successes on record—more
than six millions of his books have been sold—one
night when I had run in to see him, I got him to tell me his
story over a pipe—he smokes hard all the time he dictates
his stories, and cannot go on when his pipe goes out till it
is refilled. This is what he told me.</p>

<p class='c016'>“My first novel, though I had written a number of short
stories before this, was about the last of the three-deckers.
When it was revised and re-written quite recently, for a cheap
edition, I understood fully why, in its first form, it was not
the brilliant success I, a youth of nineteen, expected it to
be. Quite early in my literary career I made the acquaintance,
which grew into a warm friendship, of the proprietor
of a weekly fiction periodical which had attained an enormous
circulation. He was a clever editor, with a keen nose for
good stuff; and he would buy nothing else, for he had hit
upon the excellent idea that, if you gave the masses good
stuff at a low price, they would jump at it. They jumped.
I wrote the leading story for this paper for many years, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>was well paid. The serials attracted the attention of George
Munro, the famous American publisher, who was running
a similar paper in New York. He arranged for me to send
advance sheets for it, and he afterwards published the serial
in cheap book form. They had an enormous—to me a
fabulous—sale, and are still selling.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Munro started a sevenpenny magazine, asking me to
edit the English part of it, and to write a serial and a series
of short stories. I worked nearly day and night, and was
so fully occupied and contented that, absurd as it may sound,
I never gave a thought to publishing the serials in book
form here in England; notwithstanding that the books
were so popular in America that one of George Munro’s rivals
hit upon the extremely ingenious idea of waiting until half
a novel of mine was published in serial form, getting some one
else to finish it, and issuing it in volume form before I had
finished the story. Of course, this was before the International
Copyright Act. Blessings on its name!</p>

<p class='c016'>“One day, my friend, that brilliant journalist, Robert
Harborough Sherard, while sitting at my writing-desk, took
up the American edition of <i>Just a Girl</i>. When I told him
it was not published in volume form in England, he asked
my permission to take it away and try to place it. He took
it to Mr. Coulson Kernahan, who recommended it to the
publisher for whom he was reading. It came out, and, to
my surprise and delight, proved a success. The review
that, more than any other, helped me, was a very kind one
in the <i>Queen</i>.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c011'><sup>[9]</sup></a> Then, again, the books were so fortunate as
to win the approval of Dr. (now Sir) William Robertson

<p class='c016'>“The rest of my literary career, if the phrase may be
permitted me, is public property. I may add that, in my
early days, I sold the copyrights of my stories. Later on,
I got them back by the simple expedient of buying the
periodical, lock, stock and barrel, in which they had appeared;
and I am glad to be able to state that I hold now
the copyright of everything I have written. Some of the
books have been dramatised, and others are on their way to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>the stage; indeed, at an early age, I made a dramatic essay
with a little play in two acts, which was produced at the
Royalty Theatre, and obtained a success chiefly, if not
entirely, owing to the splendid cast; amongst others, I was
fortunate enough to have such actors as Richard Mansfield,
who afterwards became so famous in America, that sterling
player, Charles Denny, and Fred Everill, of the Haymarket.
It would be a poor play such men as these could not pull
through. Encouraged by my first effort, I might have
directed all my attention to the stage, but fiction had got
a firm hold upon me; it was safe and regular—and there
you are! But I am making a new start, and ‘you never
can tell,’ as Mr. Shaw says.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The story of my lecturing is soon told. I gave a lecture,
consisting of recitals linked together by biographical notes,
for a Bideford debating society. An agent who happened
to hear it, thought it good enough for the general public, and
for some years past I have, during the winter months, appeared
on the lecture platform. It is a change of work,
which is good; and it is lucrative, which is also good, if not
better.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I have just been elected President of the Institute of
Lecturers. The duties of this office will fill in my spare
time—when I get it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch (“Q”), another admirable
writer, not only of novels, but of poems and essays, I have
seen hardly at all since he left Oxford, where, sometime after
me, he occupied my old panelled set of rooms at Trinity (of
which he was a Scholar like myself, and A. E. W. Mason an
Exhibitioner some years later), attracted probably by the
fact that they had been Cardinal Newman’s rooms when he
was an undergraduate. Couch was a splendid example of
the <i>mens sana in corpore sano</i>. He was stroke of the College
boat, as well as the most brilliant Trinity man of his time
intellectually, and he looked it. He had a lithe, active
figure, and a humorous, self-reliant face, with light eyes—the
type which takes so much beating. For a brief time he
had a very successful journalistic career in London, but he
quickly decided that it was not worth while to live in London
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>unless you were rich enough to do all the nice things which
came along, and returned to his native Cornwall to devote
himself to literature. In Cornwall he not only wrote delightful
books, but went in for sailing, and became a power in
local Liberal politics, and was knighted. Recently he has
become Professor of Poetry in the University of Cambridge—a
post he was admirably fitted to fill, since the mantle
of Francis Turner Palgrave fell upon him as an anthologist.
His <i>Oxford Book of Verse</i> is simply delightful.</p>

<p class='c016'>Couch had from the first been a stylist. When congratulated
early in his career on the exquisite writing of a short
story, he deprecated its importance, because it was too
conscious an imitation of De Maupassant. “My great
difficulty is not to imitate my models,” he said. In the light
of this saying, it is interesting to recall the fact that in 1897
he was chosen for the high honour of completing Robert
Louis Stevenson’s <i>St. Ives</i>, which he did with absolute
success. Stevenson must have been one of the models he
was trying not to imitate. There is no reason why he should,
for no one could want a more delightful style than his own.
<i>Hetty Wesley</i> is an exquisite book.</p>

<p class='c016'>Sir Henry Rider Haggard I ought to have mentioned long
before this, since he has been one of the recognised heads
of the novelists’ profession for many years. Haggard had
the good fortune for an imaginative man to go out to South
Africa when he and the South African question were young.
He was on the staff of Sir Theophilus Shepstone, the Official
Commissioner in the Transvaal, and actually assisted in
hoisting the British Flag over the Republic in 1887. His
first book, published in 1882, was about South African
politics, but in 1884 he began as a novelist, with <i>Dawn</i>, and
in 1886 he achieved world-wide fame with <i>King Solomon’s
Mines</i>, one of the finest romances ever written. <i>She</i> came
out a year later, and confirmed the success. He has written
many other famous novels. For years he was always quoted
as the most successful novelist—but that was before the
days of “booming,” a practice against which Haggard has
steadily set his face. He told his agent that he would not
ever write to order, unless he was driven to it—that the bare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>fact of having signed a contract to produce a given thing by
a given time paralysed his pen. Besides writing novels of
increasing seriousness, Haggard, like Doyle, has proved
himself a patriot, with the deepest sense of his responsibilities
as a citizen. He has twice tried to get into Parliament,
with a view to legislation for restoring agriculture in England,
and he has given his time lavishly, both to the investigation
of the agricultural question and to serving on various
Commissions, as well as to writing books on various subjects
connected with the land. He came back from South Africa
and went to live in his native Norfolk many years ago,
but in spite of this he has done his duty in attending literary
gatherings. His active figure, and close-trimmed beard,
give him the cut of a naval officer.</p>

<p class='c016'>His brother, Major Arthur Haggard, who has seen much
service in Africa, and written well-known books, has done
patriotic service for his country in another way by organising
the Union Jack Club and the Veterans’ Club for soldiers
and sailors.</p>

<p class='c016'>Another visitor to Addison Mansions in latter days was
William Romaine Paterson, better known as “Benjamin
Swift”—a man of extraordinary ability, whom I should not
be surprised to see in a Radical Cabinet. The moment you
meet him you are aware that you are in the presence of an
intellect of the first rank, and an uncompromising personality.
A deep reader and thinker, he has the gift of clear expression
and glittering sarcasm. I have seldom heard a more effective
speaker. He has already written a number of remarkable
novels. He is a born leader, and he looks it, with his commanding
figure, his face, of the eagle type, and his burning
eye.</p>

<p class='c016'>I ought to have mentioned Morley Roberts before, because
he was a man of whom I saw much in those days. He was
often at our at-homes, and nearly always in the Authors’
Club when I went there. He was the greatest personality
there in those days—not only as an author whose books
every one in the Club admired, long before the public took
them at their true value, but for his wide and deep knowledge,
and for the adventures he had successfully concluded with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>his splendid physique. We always felt that Morley Roberts
was essentially a man, that the strength of his books was due
to the daring life he had led. I have very seldom heard
Morley Roberts make a speech, but I have seen him hold a
whole room of brilliant men from his easy-chair beside the
fire, while he unfolded some curious piece of knowledge with
surprising power and interestingness. It was he who said
that books of adventure are generally written by sedentary
cowards for sedentary cowards.</p>

<p class='c016'>I met Morley Roberts first at a garden-party given by
Rosamund Marriott Watson, the poetess, whose husband
I have for many years considered one of the finest novelists
of the day. She introduced us to each other because we
had both been to Australia, and I rather think that she
accused him as well as myself of having wooed the Muse of
Poetry (though there was no Muse of Poetry among the
immortal nine). After that he came a good many times to
our house, though he never was fond of at-homes, and I
don’t remember his ever coming back after his long illness.
A very strong man, six feet high, or thereabouts, with a
commanding face, and flashing dark eyes, he was always
one of the most conspicuous figures in the room. He had
been a sailor before the mast, a navvy out west, a hand on
a ranch, and I don’t know what all in his adventurous youth.</p>

<p class='c016'>It seems incredible to think that Somerset Maugham, who
is barely forty, should have been a long time coming into
his own, yet ten years elapsed between the publication of
<i>Liza of Lambeth</i> and the production of <i>Lady Frederick</i>, and
in the interval he had written those delightful books <i>The
Merry-go-Round</i> and <i>The Bishop’s Apron</i>. He came to us
with a mutual friend in the year 1897, when he had just
written <i>Liza</i>. I remember, when I read it, venturing, as
an old reviewer, to prophesy that such a writer must leap
into fame forthwith. I was sure of it when I read <i>The
Merry-go-Round</i>, but the public did not quite answer to
my expectations. I have always heard that <i>Liza of Lambeth</i>
was inspired by the gruesome sights and sounds which were
his environment when he was at St. Thomas’ Hospital,
that he lodged in some street where, from his back windows,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>he could see the she-hooligans hitting each other with their
babies. He is, a rare thing for an author, an admirable dancer.</p>

<p class='c016'>Another man born in the same year, 1874, who came to
his own through plays, and was even longer in doing it, is
Edward Knoblauch, the author of <i>Kismet</i>, and joint author
of <i>Milestones</i>. Knoblauch, who is an American, born in
New York, and educated at Harvard, and his sister, came to
us with Lena Ashwell a good many years ago. Knoblauch
was Lena’s reader at the Kingsway, and collaborated with
the Askews in <i>The Shulamite</i>, in which she created such a
splendid character. He had already adapted <i>The Partikler
Pet</i> for Cyril Maude. But he was writing plays for years
before he had a single one accepted, and it was not until
1911 that he sprang into general fame with <i>Kismet</i>, quickly
followed by <i>Milestones</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>Louis Napoleon Parker, another old member of the Authors’
Club, is a very old friend of mine. I think it was Adrian
Ross who introduced us, when he first came up from Sherborne
School, where he was appointed Director of Music
upon leaving the Royal Academy of Music. Strangely
enough, one who has composed such delightful music is
extremely deaf. For many years, of course, he has been one
of our leading and most prolific playwrights, and only a
short while ago he composed the incidental music for his
drama, <i>Drake</i>. Parker, who was born in France, and might
almost pass for a Frenchman, has been the translator of
some of the most celebrated French plays which have been
“Englished” for our stage—<i>Chanticleer</i>, <i>L’Aiglon</i> and
<i>Cyrano de Bergerac</i> among them. He has had yet another
sphere of activity in producing the series of splendid masques
which are associated with his name. He is, indeed, practically
the inventor of the masque in its present form, such as
the Sherborne pageant, the Warwick pageant and the York
pageant.</p>

</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Henry Harland</span>, who justly made such a prodigious hit
with that exquisite book, <i>The Cardinal’s Snuff-box</i>, I knew
well in America. Stedman introduced us at one of his
at-homes. He wrote then under the pseudonym of “Sidney
Luska,” and was best known for some big action he had had
with some firm of publishers in New York, the American
Cassells, I think. He was a very opinionated man, and I did
not at the time believe that he would ever write so fine a book
as <i>The Cardinal’s Snuff-box</i>, which breathes the very air of
Italy, and is the most exquisite idyll of Italian life which we
have in the language. But it is only just to him to say that
Stedman, in introducing him, spoke of him in terms which
should have made me believe this. He was born in St.
Petersburg, and looked rather like a Russian. He would
have been fifty-two if he had been alive. Lane always
believed in him, and made him editor of the <i>Yellow Book</i>.
He and his pretty little wife had a flat in Cromwell Road,
and were popular in the “precious” section of literary
society. His early death was a great loss to literature.</p>

<p class='c016'>Frank Bullen is one of the most interesting personalities
I have met in literature. He is so many-sided in his abilities
and his experiences. After being an errand-boy, and everything
up to chief officer on a sailing-ship, and a clerk in the
meteorological office at Greenwich, he became a writer, an
orator and a philanthropist. No one has done more for the
men of the Merchant Service, for while he did all that man
could for them practically, he enlisted the sympathies of
the world for them in his books. A small, dark man, with
very bright eyes, and a sympathetic manner, except when
he is moved to indignation, he was born to dominate great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>audiences, especially when he is telling them of wrongs
which need practical redress. The wonders of the Lord
which he saw when he went down to the sea in ships, made
such a profound impression on his imagination that they fill
the pages of his books with eloquence and knowledge. With
the exception of Joseph Conrad, he has no rival among living
writers as a sea-novelist. I think I met him at the Idler
first. I know that we became friends from the first day.</p>

<p class='c016'>Dion Clayton Calthrop, that prince of light novelists, who
is always finding fame by some new stroke of genius, was
our neighbour for several years at Addison Mansions. He
is such a distinguished-looking man that I used to watch him
and wonder who he was, until one night I met him through
a mutual friend. It is not surprising that he is so brilliant,
because he is the son of John Clayton, the actor, and grandson
of Dion Boucicault.</p>

<p class='c016'>When I asked Calthrop, who started as an artist, what
made him take up writing, he said—</p>

<p class='c016'>“I really took up writing owing to a bout of insomnia
when I was living in Paris, and as I was painting in the schools
all day, I tried to write at night. I read the sketches to
Norman Angell, a friend of mine (who wrote <i>The Great
Illusion</i>), and through him met Manuel, the artist, and
through him they were published in <i>The Butterfly</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I believe in many irons in the fire; people specialise
too much, so I have books, plays, dress designs, or scene
models, and a picture or two, all going at once, and it is a
great cause for regret to me that I cannot write music. In
the great days of Art, artists were so interested in life that
they tried everything—why shouldn’t we? I even have
a rock-garden full of Alpine flowers on my writing desk—true,
it is only four feet by one—but it is very interesting to
see flowers grow as you work. As a matter of fact, I am
writing against an Alpine crocus, trying to finish a book as
it comes into bloom.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Desmond Coke, one of the most brilliant of our younger
novelists, I met in 1904 through his mother, Mrs. Talbot
Coke, who had been my colleague on the <i>Queen</i>, the wife
of one of our generals in the Boer War. Mrs. Talbot Coke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>was at the time—as she is still—one of the principal contributors
to <i>Hearth and Home</i>, a paper which served as a
literary cradle to Robert Hichens, whilst it was sub-edited
by no less a personage than Arnold Bennett, who was just
beginning to write his series of great novels about the pottery
towns.</p>

<p class='c016'>Desmond Coke, who, under the pseudonym of “Charbon,”
wrote the reviews in a lively strain, possibly sometimes more
welcome to his readers than to the novelist reviewed, was at
the time I speak of fresh from Oxford, which he had made his
own in fiction with that delirious skit on feminine fiction,
<i>Sandford of Merton</i>. Since then he has written a number of
novels, distinguished for their original ideas. He has long
been a keen collector, as his chambers in a backwater off
Oxford Street show, and has of late turned his collecting to
good account by writing the classic on <i>The Art of Silhouette</i>.
He is very accomplished, and is one of the chief pillars of
Chapman &amp; Hall’s publishing house. The announcement,
however, that Mr. H. B. Irving has secured his three-act
play, <i>One Hour of Life</i>, proves that here is yet another novelist
who, given the opportunity, would gladly exchange the
quiet covers of Bookland for the more adventurous and hectic
boards of Theatredom!</p>

<p class='c016'>E. H. Cooper was a very dear friend of mine, who came near
being one of the conspicuous figures of his time. He had
a short life and a merry one—merry, at all events, for his
friends. He was, perhaps, too cynical ever to be quite
merry himself, except with children. His father was a
Staffordshire country gentleman, with an estate adjoining
the Duke of Sutherland’s, and the Duchess and her children
and her nephews and nieces were much attached to that
wayward genius. While he was still an undergraduate at
Oxford, he contracted the taste for gambling on horse-races,
which kept him a poor man, but enabled him to write one
of the best racing novels of the language—<i>Mr. Blake of
Newmarket</i>. That did not prevent him from writing delightful
children’s books, inspired by the Duchess’s children.
He was a very handsome and romantic-looking man, with
wonderful iron-grey eyes, but, like Byron, was born lame.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>For a brief time he edited the <i>Daily Mail</i>, as a <i>locum tenens</i>,
I believe, and for a long time he was Paris correspondent
of the <i>New York World</i>. Once, during that period, he made
a big coup at Chantilly, and for some days pressed me with
letters and telegrams to go and stay with him for a week
at Paris and “paint the town absolutely red” at his expense.
We were to stay at the Ritz. He said he was going to be
really rich for a week, and it would supply me with the
material for a whole novel. But if he was determined to
waste his one stroke of luck, I was not going to be a party to
it, and I not only refused, but did my utmost to wean him
from the idea—unsuccessfully, I think. If Cooper had really
given his mind to novel-writing and journalism, he might have
made a great name, for he was brilliantly clever, and his distinction
of manner made him an impressive figure in society.</p>

<p class='c016'>We were drawing near the end of our time at Addison
Mansions when I met Jeffery Farnol. Farnol, who is still
young, is as likely as any one to rank among the foremost
novelists of his time. His <i>Broad Highway</i> is one of the best
books produced by the generation, and <i>The Amateur Gentleman</i>
was a good successor to it. He is an Englishman born,
but lived some time in America, where he made his living
as a scene-painter. There he wrote his great novel, and
after disappointments in searching for a publisher he sent
it to Shirley Byron Jevons, at that time editor of the <i>Sportsman</i>,
a relative of the celebrated Professor Stanley Jevons,
the Political Economist, and brother of Dr. Frank Jevons,
Vice-Chancellor of Durham University, he himself being
now connected with literary journalism. Shirley Jevons at
once recognised it as something like a work of genius, and
taking it to the old firm of Sampson Low, Marston &amp; Co.,
Ltd., told them that they must publish it. It made its way
a little slowly at first, but then the public, led by the strong
convictions of one man, swept him on to fame on an irresistible
tide. Farnol was born in Birmingham thirty-five
years ago. His parents came to London when he was seven,
and he has made a suburb of it, Lee, in Kent, his permanent
home, though business may take him to the United States
for months at a time.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>He married in his early twenties the daughter of Hawley,
the scenic and architectural artist, an Englishman living in
America. She was on a visit to relatives in England, and the
rash young couple, soon after the birth of a daughter, their
only child, resolved to try their fortunes on the other side
of the Atlantic, the plucky and fascinating little wife sharing
there his bad fortune as now she shares his good. The
struggle was hard enough for a time, and, if Farnol cared to
relate all that he went through in those years, the story would
be a human document of great interest. At my house he
met Yoshio Markino. I was about to introduce the already
famous Jap to the coming young Englishman, when the
impulsive Markino rushed at and fondled him, crying out
in delight, “Why, it’s Jacky!” They had been fellow-students
at the Goldsmiths’ Institute when both were younger,
and both unknown to fame. There Farnol had shown
welcome little kindnesses to the lonely, warm-hearted
stranger from Nippon. Their ways had parted, neither
thinking to see the other again, and least of all in this dramatic
fashion and in these brighter circumstances. <i>The Broad
Highway</i> has been dramatised for America, and is to be staged
in England. <i>The Amateur Gentleman</i> is also to be adapted
to the stage. His third important story—he has done many
shorter things—is likely to be of modern times.</p>

<p class='c016'>Francis Gribble is a very old friend of mine; we belonged
to the same literary clubs, and met constantly at them, and
he and his charming Dutch wife were often at Addison
Mansions. Gribble, who is an Oxford First Class man,
besides his very able novels and his biographies, which are
recognised as classics on their subject, has made a neglected
aspect of Switzerland his particular province. He is the
authority on the Swiss towns, like Geneva and Lauzanne,
where so much of the scenes of some of his biographies had
necessarily to be laid. He now spends a good deal of his
time in Continental travel. I remember his telling me that
it was through his study of Swiss towns that he was led on
to write biography. The connecting link was his accidental
perusal of that wonderful book, <i>Benjamin Constant’s Journal
Intime</i>. He saw from it that the life of Madame de Staël
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>needed to be written from a new point of view, then he was
led on to cover the whole ground of the romantic movement
in French literature from Rousseau to Victor Hugo.</p>

<p class='c016'>Frank Hird I have known many years. I met him first
as editor of some important journal—I forget what—with
which I was arranging a contribution, just as I met C. N.
Williamson first as sub-editor of the <i>Graphic</i>. I was astonished
to find myself in the presence of a person who was
hardly more than a boy, very good-looking, very well-bred,
very well dressed. Since then I have met him repeatedly,
and enjoyed the friendship of one who fully came up to my
first prepossession. I have met him most, I think, at the
hospitable villa of the Joseph Whitakers’ in Palermo, where
he frequently stayed, and showed himself as good in private
theatricals as he is as an author. The place where he seemed
most in his element was when he was correspondent to one
of the chief London newspapers in Rome, and I used to
meet him in salons like the Countess Lovatelli’s. The
Countess was the sister of the Duke of Sermoneta, one of
the highest of the Roman nobility, who has a similar position
to our Duke of Norfolk. The Sermoneta family have a
proud record in Italian archæology; the Countess herself
is an author, and, as a centre of public and literary life, the
Lady St. Helier of Rome. Her “salon” is said to be the
only one in which the “Whites” and the “Blacks” habitually
meet. He was always the diplomatist, more than the
correspondent, though he was so excellent at his own work,
and would have risen high in diplomacy if he had made it
his career.</p>

<p class='c016'>Edgar Jepson and his wife were often at Addison Mansions,
and I used to meet him constantly at the Authors’ Club as
I now meet him at the Dilettanti. He is a man in whom
his friends believed from the first, and the quality of his books
and his speaking have amply justified them. Intellectually
he is a typical Balliol man, but that does not prevent his
being one of the delights of Bohemia, where his popularity
is unbounded. Experts are agreed that on his day, he is
the second best, if not the best, auction-bridge player in
England. He says of himself, that he is a walking warning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>against writing fiction, since from his first book he made 0,
from his second six pounds nineteen and nine, and from
his third nine pounds ten and fivepence.</p>

<p class='c016'>William le Queux has been an intimate friend of mine for
many years. A Frenchman by birth, he is a strongly
Imperialist Englishman by naturalisation, and in his writings
and politics. He has led a most interesting life. He was
once an artist in the Quartier Latin, but he deserted this for
journalism, and was sent by <i>The Times</i> as a special correspondent
to Russia, using the opportunity to acquire an
extraordinary knowledge of the secret workings of the
Nihilists, just as he has in recent years been very much behind
the scenes in the Balkans and Turkey. For a while he was
sub-editor of the <i>Globe</i>, which post he resigned as soon as
his success as a novelist justified it. Since then he has
travelled continually, and acquired a unique knowledge of
the secret service of the Continental Powers. He is one
of the most popular novelists of the day, the secret of his
popularity lying in his brilliant handling of mysteries, and
the use he makes of his knowledge behind the scenes in
Continental politics. His books dealing with supposed
invasions of England are masterpieces in their way, showing
an extraordinary grasp of military details. A member of
the Athenæum Club told me once that judges and bishops
almost quarrelled with each other when a new William le
Queux book came into the Club. His affable face, with
bright, dark eyes, behind <i>pince-nez</i>, and an inscrutable
expression, is familiar to frequenters of the Devonshire
Club and the Hotel Cecil. The curious thing is that, though
we have been such friends, and have been frequent visitors
to the same places on the Continent, from the little republic
of San Marino, of which he is Consul-General, upwards,
we have never, so far as I remember, met out of England.</p>

<p class='c016'>Bertram Mitford lived side by side with myself and “Adrian
Ross” at Addison Mansions for years. He belongs to one of
the oldest families in England. His father, the late E. L.
Osbaldeston Mitford, of Mitford in Northumberland, which
has been in the possession of his family since Saxon times,
appearing in Doomsday Book, was a wonderful old gentleman;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>he lived to be more than a hundred years old, and,
till a few years before his death, used to come up to London
for first nights at his favourite theatres.</p>

<p class='c016'>Bertram Mitford is a good sportsman, who has travelled
and shot in the back parts of South Africa, and the wild
lands bordering on India and Afghanistan. His travels have
inspired novels which are splendid books of adventure.
He has also been in Italy a good deal.</p>

<p class='c016'>Guise Mitford, who has written one or two good novels,
is his cousin, as is the stately Lord Redesdale, the head of
a cadet branch of his family, who wrote the famous <i>Tales
of Old Japan</i>. Miss Mitford, too, a once most popular
authoress, was of the clan.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mitford and I used to see each other constantly in Addison
Mansions, and frequently at two or three clubs to which
we both belonged, but I don’t remember ever doing the
journey between together, between them and our flats.
He often walked both ways for the exercise.</p>

<p class='c016'>K. J. Key, the great cricketer, who for many years held
the record for the Oxford and Cambridge match, with his
130, and was afterwards Captain of the Surrey Eleven for
years, one of my most valued friends, introduced me to
Charles Marriott, of whose novels he was an immense admirer.
Key is a great reader. Unlike most cricketers, who prefer
to watch the game intently until they go in to bat, as if they
were playing whist or bridge, and wanted to see what cards
were out, he used to read a book or a newspaper till it was
his turn to go in, and I have no doubt that he saved a good
deal of nerve energy by doing so. I think he met Marriott
in Cornwall, to which they are both devoted. Certainly,
they are both fond of photography. Marriott made a
considerable <i>succès d’estime</i> with his first novel, <i>The Column</i>.
He is, or was until recently, the Art critic of one of the great
London dailies, and is a most accomplished man, of wide
knowledge, and one of the best novelists of the day. Living
at Brook Green, he was a near neighbour of ours, and from
the time that Key introduced us to the time that we left
Addison Mansions, we saw a good deal of him. Key’s wife
has recently published a novel with a cricketer (not her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>husband) for its hero—<i>A Daughter of Love</i>. She is a sister
of Lascelles Abercombie.</p>

<p class='c016'>Compton Mackenzie first came to Addison Mansions as
a small boy at St. Paul’s School, where he was a friend of
my son. They began to be men very early in my son’s
little cupboard of a study, overlooking Lyon’s cake-factory.
I did not see him after he made his fame as a novelist till
we came to live at Richmond. He has, like myself, a passion
for gardening. He is, of course, a son of Edward Compton,
the actor, and Virginia Bateman, and his great-grandmother
was a Symonds, aunt of John Addington Symonds, so there
is one of the best strains of literary ability in the family. The
famous Sir Morell Mackenzie was Edward Compton’s cousin.</p>

<p class='c016'>When I wrote to ask Compton Mackenzie, who is now
indulging his passion for gardening by living in Capri and
making landscapes round his house, what first impelled him
to write novels, he said—</p>

<p class='c016'>“I can remember shooting peas at your guests as they
came in, and throwing cake, etc. I don’t suppose we did it
always, but I distinctly remember doing it once or twice.
It is difficult to extract anything from the past and account
for my writing novels. Yet I always had a passion for
writing. In the Upper Sixth in 1896, I, with two other boys,
ran a paper called <i>The Hectona</i>, of which, so far as I know,
only two numbers are in existence. It was printed on
gelatine, and all the contributions were copied out by myself
in my execrable handwriting. Like many magazines since,
it expired of illegibility. Later, at Oxford, I ran another
paper called <i>The Oxford Point of View</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Gardening I took up to console myself for not being
able to find a publisher for my first book. It toured round
London for nearly two years, and I did not sit down and
write <i>The Carnival</i> until <i>The Passionate Elopement</i> lay bound
upon my table. This was according to a vow I had made.
I started very early. <i>The Passionate Elopement</i> was printed
just after I was twenty-five. It was originally—or some
of it—a play which I wrote to console my father for having
got married without warning or expectation. That was
when I was twenty-two.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>“<i>The Carnival</i>, I suppose, may be called the result of
helping my brother-in-law, poor Harry Pelissier, with his
Alhambra Revue. I used to rehearse the Corps de Ballet,
and, I suppose, naturally made use of such an opportunity
to make a book.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Lord Monkswell, who wrote a single novel, and whose
sister, the Contessa Arturo di Cadilhac, born Margaret
Collier, has written some valuable books about life in Italy,
I met constantly as one of the directors of the Authors’
Club. He was also my sponsor for another club. He was
very regular in his attendances at the Board Meetings of the
Authors’ Club, which he occasionally illuminated with a
naïve outbreak, as in his dictum about the National Liberal
Club. At one of our Board Meetings, I was advocating
some change in the financial arrangements of the billiard-room,
and quoted as an example to be followed the rule at
the National Liberal Club.</p>

<p class='c016'>“National Liberal Club!” cried Lord Monkswell, who
was at that time Under-Secretary for War in a Liberal
Government; “why, I don’t call that a club at all—I call it
a railway station!”</p>

<p class='c016'>Richard Orton Prowse has won admiration in high places
with his work. One of his novels ran as a serial in the
<i>Cornhill</i>, and he had a play produced by the “Stage Society.”
He used to come to Addison Mansions because we were in
the same small house at Cheltenham College—Gantillon’s,
in Fauconberg Terrace. There were only about half-a-dozen
boys in the house, but we used to knock up a game of
football on a waste bit of ground at the back of the terrace,
with two small day-boys who lived in an adjoining house.
There were not more than eight of us all told—I think only
seven, and of the seven, besides Prowse and myself, there
were the two famous Renshaws, and the two famous Lambs.
The Renshaws were very small boys in those days, but so
absolutely certain in their catching, and their drop-kicking,
that they counted in football games with boys three or four
years older. When they grew up, their extraordinary scientificness
in games was proved in the lawn-tennis courts,
because for years, until one of them died by his own hand,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>they were undisputed champions. As it happened, I never
met either of them after they left school, but one day I was
driving through a remote Buckinghamshire village, White
Waltham or something of the kind, with a friend, when we
observed a crowd, in the street outside the village pound,
of persons whom you would not have expected in such a
place. We inquired what the trouble was, and found
that it was an inquest on a suicide—one of the famous
Renshaws.</p>

<p class='c016'>Curiously enough, there was the same element of tragedy
in the history of the brothers Lamb—Captain Thomas Lamb
and Captain Edward Lamb, were for years the finest shots
in the British army. Edward Lamb was the only boy who
ever won the Spencer Cup twice; when he was at school,
there had never been such a shot at a public school. Thomas
Lamb, who had the finest nerve I ever remember in any one,
broke down in a match when he went over to the United
States to represent England, and was so mortified that he
shot himself on the way home.</p>

<p class='c016'>I shall always remember with pride that I was the first
person who ever put a rifle into the hands of those two
Lambs. I taught them how to shoot, and did most of the
explaining in that house in Fauconberg Terrace, Cheltenham.
I was at the time Captain of the school shooting eight, and
I had won the Spencer Cup myself in the Public Schools
matches at the preceding Wimbledon Meeting. I rather
despaired about Tommy Lamb; he was not quick at taking
things in, but I knew that if he could learn to shoot, his nerve
and his doggedness might carry him to any heights of success.
The houses of Fauconberg Terrace were very high, and there
was a high parapet about a foot wide on the roof. I have
seen Tommy Lamb run along that parapet from end to end.
He said, “If it was only two or three feet from the ground,
instead of two or three feet from the roof, it would be nothing.
Why should it make any difference? It is all the same to
me.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Several feet from our study window, which had a storey
underneath it, there was a railing of about the same width.
He used to jump from our window on to that railing, and keep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>his balance. Anybody could do it, he said, if it was nearer
the ground. Why should it make any difference?</p>

<p class='c016'>And he was always ready to jump from a height of twenty
or thirty feet, and never hurt himself.</p>

<p class='c016'>The seventh boy in those football games was Frank Lamb,
the youngest brother. I never heard if he did anything in
after life, but we six, I am quite sure, had no thought beyond
a football which bounced so unevenly on that piece of
waste land.</p>

<p class='c016'>Tommy Lamb was a very fine fellow, singularly modest
about his achievements. Several years afterwards, when I
first came back from Australia, I went down to Wimbledon
to see the Public Schools Veterans’ Match, in which I had
captained Cheltenham three or four times. Lamb, who was
then in the flower of his shooting, was very anxious that
I should take his place in that year’s team. He thought it
so wrong that I should not be shooting. I had, fortunately,
not fired off a rifle for at least three years, or I should have
had great difficulty in dissuading him from effacing himself
for me, and if I had been at my very best he would have been
heavens above me in the form he showed. That was the
sort of man he was. We were in the same house at Cheltenham
for two or three years, so I knew him extremely well.</p>

<p class='c016'>These chapters in no way exhaust the list of my novelist
friends—they are merely reminiscences which I thought likely
to interest readers about some of them. I have not mentioned,
for instance, one of my greatest friends, that brilliant
historical novelist, John Bloundelle-Burton; or Hornung,
Doyle’s brother-in-law, whom I first met out in Australia
thirty years ago; or Richard Pryce, that dainty novelist and
playwright; and I have passed by many other well-known
authors whom I knew equally well and saw very often.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXIV<br /> <br /><span class='c022'>OTHER AUTHOR FRIENDS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>One</span> is apt to let fiction speak for itself, as if it represented
the whole of literature. But it does not. Several of the
men mentioned below are novelists, but they owe their
importance more to other books.</p>

<p class='c016'>The late W. H. Wilkins, who was much at our house, is
an example. Wilkins, who was the son and heir of a West
Country Squire, was an extraordinary mixture—a man of
fashion, who was at the same time an industrious museum-worker.
He wrote admirable books on the Georgian Courts.
But he will be best remembered as the editor to whom Lady
Burton entrusted her manuscripts for publication. It was
from him that I learned the irreparable loss which she inflicted
on literature by burning a number of Burton’s manuscripts
because of the grossnesses which they contained.
There was no reason why any of these grossnesses should
have been published—the manuscripts could have been
printed with lacunæ where these passages occurred, and the
manuscripts could have been left to the nation in the British
Museum on condition that the offending passages never were
published. But the idea of burning unpublished works
about Arabia, by the greatest of all explorers of Arabia and
students of Arab customs, was too infamous. Wilkins put
it down to her religion. She was a very ardent Roman
Catholic.</p>

<p class='c016'>He had a good deal to do with the <i>Ladies’ Realm</i> in its
early days, when it was published by Hutchinson, and I
believe he had a good deal to do with the formation of the
fortnightly part publications for which this house is famous.
He certainly was a friend and constant adviser of Hutchinson’s.
His books enjoyed a considerable sale. The novel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>he wrote in collaboration with Herbert Vivian was one of the
last of the three-volumers.</p>

<p class='c016'>Wilkins was a man of strong likes and dislikes, very
affectionate to his friends. Like E. H. Cooper, he was a
well-known figure in society as well as in literary circles—and,
curiously enough, he, too, was lame.</p>

<p class='c016'>Joseph Shaylor, the managing secretary of the Whitefriars
Club, and the managing director of Simpkin, Marshall,
Hamilton, Kent &amp; Co., the largest wholesale booksellers
in the world, I have known almost as long. It is interesting
to note that Shaylor, besides being the largest dealer in
books commercially, has a most intimate and discriminating
knowledge of all the books which are worth reading, and
issues delightful little books on books, including his dear
little annual <i>From Friend to Friend</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>Every one knows his volume called <i>The Fascination of
Books</i>. His career is a romance; it reminds one of Dick
Whittington. He has himself told us that he is a self-made
man—<i>i. e.</i> he has had nothing but his own intelligence and
grit to help him. He was born in Stroud in 1844, where he
was apprenticed to a bookseller named Clark. It was part
of Shaylor’s duty to fetch the London papers from the train
in the morning. In 1864 he came to London, at once entering
the firm of Simpkin, Marshall &amp; Co. His diligence and
business acumen generally was noted, and after a while he
was given charge of one of the departments. It became
increasingly evident to his employers that their confidence
in, and judgment of, this young man from the country had
not been misplaced, and within five or six years after the
formation of the company, as it now stands, Shaylor was
elected to the position of one of the managing directors.</p>

<p class='c016'>Shaylor is an authority on the history of books and bookselling,
and has many interesting stories to tell of how things
were done in the trade years ago, when life was more leisurely.
In those golden days, reviewers had some power; a good
review in <i>The Times</i> sold two hundred thousand copies of
<i>The Fight at Dame Europa’s School</i>, timidly brought out in
the very smallest way, and an article in <i>The World</i> sold four
hundred copies of <i>Called Back</i>. How a book sells depends
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>very much upon the original subscription before publication,
of which Shaylor, as head of the world’s biggest buyers, thinks
it worthy. Of him it may be justly said that he has his finger
on the pulse of English literature and that his diagnosis is
accepted by the world.</p>

<p class='c016'>Ernest Thompson Seton—who took for his pen-name
Ernest Seton Thompson—came to us first many years ago,
when he became engaged to a friend of ours, the beautiful
Grace Gallatin, daughter of the Speaker of the California
House of Representatives. A descendant of the last Earl
of Winton, he went to Canada when he was only five, and
lived in the backwoods for ten years. Then he went to
school and college in Canada, and had two years’ art-training
in London before he returned to Manitoba to study natural
history, eventually becoming naturalist to the Manitoba
Government. In 1898, when he was thirty-eight years old,
he published his <i>Wild Animals I have Known—the Biographies
of Eight Wild Animals</i>, which went through ten editions in
the first year, and was the foundation of his fame and large
fortune. He founded the outdoor-life movement, known as
<i>The Woodcraft Indians</i>, which has a membership of nearly
a hundred thousand, and in addition to his soundness as a
naturalist, he is the most dramatic lecturer I have ever
heard. He lectures on the psychology of wild animals as
if they were human beings, and is said to be the most popular
lecturer living. His books about wild animals have delightful
sketches of animal playfulness and humanness in their
margins, some of which are by himself, and some by his wife.</p>

<p class='c016'>Dr. Dillon, whose articles in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> on the
Balkan question during the war formed the most illuminating
comment on the subject, I have been meeting for years at
Violet Hunt’s. He is an elderly man, who looks more the
scholar and the recluse than the publicist with his finger
on the pulse of all Eastern Europe.</p>

<p class='c016'>Max Beerbohm, Sir Herbert Beerbohm-Tree’s brother, is
recognised as one of the most brilliant wits and intuitive
critics of the day, as well as our most inspired caricaturist.
There are few educated people in England who are not
familiar with his work. I met him first at a dinner of the
Women Journalists. We were both guests of the Club, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>Mrs. T. P. O’Connor, who was in the chair, said to me, “You
know Max Beerbohm, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c016'>I did not know him, though I had always wanted to know
him, because I was a great admirer of his work and his wit.
I said, “No, I don’t,” and was about to add what pleasure
it would give me, when he took the words out of my mouth by
saying, “I refuse not to be known by Mr. Douglas Sladen.”
That was our introduction.</p>

<p class='c016'>He was in splendid form that night. He and a man with
an unpronounceable Polish name, who was one of the leading
foreign journalists in London, were deputed to reply for the
visitors. The Pole, who spoke very broken English, at
interminable length, made Max Beerbohm very angry,
because he hated the idea of speaking to a jaded audience,
so when at length his colleague sat down, and he rose to
make his speech, he began, “I, too, am a foreigner. I go
about in holy terror of the Tariff Reform League.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The audience recognised that he was really alluding to
the Aliens Act, and rocked with laughter.</p>

<p class='c016'>I remember Mark Twain being similarly annoyed at a dinner
of the American Society, when he had to speak after a number
of verbose platitudinarians. He was quite dispirited when
he rose, and confined himself to a few sentences. After the
dinner was over, he told me this, and he went on to say,
“But I was wrong, for the late Sir Henry Brackenbury
spoke after me, and look what he did with the audience!
He took them up in his hand, and moved them to tears
and laughter, just as he pleased.”</p>

<p class='c016'>That speech of Sir Henry’s certainly was magnificently
eloquent. It was during, or just after, the South African
War, and the phrases in which he alluded to the war swept the
audience, though they were mostly Americans, right off their
feet; they were as fine as John Bright’s immortal allusion
to hearing the angels’ wings in his Crimean War speech.
I only once heard a finer speech—the sermon preached in
St. Paul’s by the present Archbishop of York, then Bishop
of Stepney, upon the centenary of Nelson’s death. In that
sermon over and over again the words were flames. There
is nothing so inspiring as a supreme speech at a supreme
moment.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>Dr. G. C. Williamson, the art editor of George Bell &amp;
Sons, is one of the most potent figures in the world of art—in
fact, there are few branches of art on which he has not
got any reasonable information at his fingers’ tips. He has
written books which have met with wide acceptation on
several of them, and has been a great collector and traveller.</p>

<p class='c016'>I met him under curious circumstances. We were both,
though I did not know him then, in St. Peter’s, witnessing
the Jubilee of Leo XIII. On occasions like this in Italy no
one interferes with the liberty of the sight-seer, and as I
was not, in the nature of things, likely to see the Jubilee of
another Pope, and I had to write a description of it, I determined
to seize whatever opportunity I could for seeing it,
without any <i>mauvais honte</i>. The cathedral had been so
packed for the past six hours that it was practically impossible
to see anything unless you seized some coign of vantage.
Williamson and I were standing close to one of the great
piers of the nave, and the base had a projection some feet
from the ground. I determined to stand on it, but he was
between me and the pier. He very good-naturedly made
way for me, and helped me to scramble up, calling out “<i>Viva
il papa re! Viva il papa re!</i>” all the time. I offered, of
course, to share my giddy eminence with him, turn and turn
about, but he was a devout Catholic, and though he saw no
harm in my ambitions, which he furthered so nobly, he was
quite content to be in the church, and worshipping. He did
not want to see more than everybody saw without striving,
when at last it happened—the carrying of the frail old
Pope on his <i>Sedia Gestatoria</i>, supported on men’s shoulders,
between the snow-white <i>flabella</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>When it was all over, we exchanged cards, and that was
the beginning of my friendship with the famous art critic.</p>

<p class='c016'>It certainly was about the most impressive sight I ever
saw—that vast cathedral, packed with a hundred thousand
human beings, with the nonagenarian Pope dressed in snow-white
garments borne on his moving throne from the High
Altar to the Chapel of the Crucifix.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is not too much to say that literary London felt a shock
when it heard that William Sinclair had resigned the Archdeaconry
of London which he had held with such conspicuous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>success for twenty-two years, and retired to a Sussex benefice.
He had been one of the foremost figures in every London
function of the time, since the Jubilee of Queen Victoria,
and he had started life as a Scholar of Balliol and President
of the Union—the University Debating Society at Oxford.
Being a bachelor, there was no reason why he should restrict
himself to dining at home, and, consequently, he was the
most prominent figure at public dinners, of a patriotic,
philanthropic or useful character, where he spoke comparatively
seldom, considering what a good speaker he is.
Being a connection of half the Scottish aristocracy—he is
a cousin of the Lord of the Isles—he was equally conspicuous
in country house parties. A constant attendant at the
functions of the Authors’ and other literary clubs, his eminence
as an ecclesiastic and a public man obscured the fact
that his performances as an author were among the most
distinguished of those present, for he has a gift of saying
wise things in epigrammatic form. His <i>magnum opus</i> is a
book on his own cathedral, and here I may incidentally
remark that few archdeacons have ever exercised such
influence on the Dean over the care of the cathedral. His
great object was to emphasise the voice of St. Paul’s as that
of the nation in its religious aspect, and it was with this view
that he prevailed on the Dean and Chapter and the Crown
to install the Imperial Order of St. Michael and St. George
in the Chapel of the Cathedral where they meet for annual
commemorations. His loss, also, from the Sunday afternoon
pulpit of St. Paul’s has been distinctly felt. It was one of
the institutions of London. He was a wise man to retire
for leisure to write and travel while he was still in his prime.</p>

<p class='c016'>Basil Wilberforce, the Archdeacon of Westminster, and
son of the great Bishop, I came to know because we used to
meet at dinner at Lady Lindsay’s. It was there that I
heard him declare his firm faith in the Holy Grail—I am
refering to the vessel which had been discovered a short
time before at Glastonbury Abbey, and which was believed
to emanate a luminous <i>aura</i> at night, from time to time.
The Archdeacon declined the honour of having it left in his
bedroom at night to test the truth of the allegation, either
because he thought his emotions might act on his imagination,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>or because he did not think himself worthy, but I
understand that it was left in Sir William Crookes’, the great
F.R.S.’s room for three nights without his observing any
phenomena.</p>

<p class='c016'>I remember George Russell—the Rt. Hon. G. W. E.
Russell, the editor of Matthew Arnold’s letters, and Under-Secretary
for India in Lord Rosebery’s Government—who
was present that night, interposing a jarring note of incredulity,
which the Archdeacon very sweetly forgave in an
old friend.</p>

<p class='c016'>Until her prolonged absences from London for ill-health,
Mrs. Neish, the wife of the Registrar of the Privy Council,
was, on account of the remarkable rapidity with which she
made her way in literature as well as for her beauty, a conspicuous
figure in London literary society. She made her
way so quickly because she was a born writer, and mingled
the witty and the pathetic naturally. She was a daughter
of Sir Edwin Galsworthy. There is literature in the family.
She is a first cousin of the great novelist and playwright,
John Galsworthy. Her husband’s father was a Scottish
laird, who in an inspired moment advanced the capital for
founding the <i>Dundee Advertiser</i>. She has often done the
<i>Saturday Westminster</i> and written many nature sketches.</p>

<p class='c016'>One of the principal figures in literary society, and one of
my most valued friends, is M. H. Spielmann, the great art
critic who discovered and bought the lost Velasquez a year
or two ago. Spielmann was for seventeen years editor of
the <i>Magazine of Art</i>, and is an authority on <i>Punch</i>
and its contributors, as well as on painting and sculpture.
He is the author of several standard works, and has been
juror in the Fine Arts’ section of innumerable exhibitions.
He is also a keen politician on the Conservative side, though
he is the brother-in-law of the Rt. Hon. Herbert Samuel,
and is an admirable speaker. But you always feel that it is
not his accomplishments which count in Spielmann, though
he has so many; it is himself—his shining character, his
almost feminine gentleness and considerateness, combined
with unusual firmness and principle. There are few men
in London who could be so ill spared as Spielmann.</p>

</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>I ought</span> to say something here of the interesting people I
have known, who never happened to come to Addison
Mansions, for one reason or another.</p>

<p class='c016'>Distance prevented the great Dr. Boyd of St. Andrews—the
famous A.K.H.B., of whom I saw a good deal in the long
summer I spent at St. Andrews—from coming. Dr. Boyd
possessed the most crushing powers of repartee of any person
I ever met. One day, when he was walking with me along
the street at St. Andrews, which leads down to the links,
some one presented an American publisher, a partner in a
famous firm, to him.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I am very glad to meet you, Dr. Boyd,” said the publisher.
“I enjoyed your <i>Scenes from Clerical Life</i> so
much.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I did not write that book, sir,” said the terrible Doctor.
“I wrote <i>The Recreations of a Country Parson</i>—and you ought
to know it, because your firm stole them both.”</p>

<p class='c016'>I once unconsciously helped him in using this talent, which
happened in this wise. Dr. Boyd was a reformer as drastic
as John Knox. The great humanising movement in the
Scottish Church, which made its services and music so much
more beautiful and its attitude so much less angular, was
largely his work, for he was not only one of the most eloquent
of the notable ministers who worked for it, but he had any
amount of backbone. An old ultra-Protestant lady, having
perceived this, paid an evangelist a thousand a year to go
about Scotland preaching against him. One Sunday he was
at St. Andrews, on the public space where the inhabitants
used to practice archery, preaching against Dr. Boyd. His
preaching was all “limehousing,” an appeal to the coarsest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>prejudice, most banal abuse and derision. It was so ludicrous
that I took most of it down in longhand, in the intervals when
he paused for applause, as he did whenever he imagined that
he was scoring. It so happened that I was having afternoon-tea
with Dr. Boyd, and that he was preaching in his own
church that evening. I began to sympathise with him in
being made the subject of such a persecution.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Were you there?” he asked. I nodded.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Do you remember at all what he said?”</p>

<p class='c016'>I produced my notes.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Do you mind reading them out to me?” he asked, after
a despairing glance at the writing. I did. He took no
notes; but he had an admirable memory, and he evidently
took it all in, for that evening, without having lowered his
dignity by being present at the evangelist’s attack on him,
he turned the tables on the offender from his own pulpit,
with a dissection of his remarks which can only be compared
to throwing vitriol, though it was all done with beautiful
polish and observance of form.</p>

<p class='c016'>He was never more amusing than when he was sympathising
about the difficulties which he described Andrew Lang
as experiencing when he came to St. Andrews. He was such
a master of innuendo.</p>

<p class='c016'>Dr. Boyd wrote his books in handwriting so minute that
he could get two thousand words on to one foolscap page.
The firm who always printed them for his publishers had
large magnifying glasses fitted to the case on which his copy
was fixed for setting it up. And Dr. Boyd was very proud
of it.</p>

<p class='c016'>One of Dr. Boyd’s sons has inherited his power as a writer—my
friend Charles Boyd, who acted for some time as
private secretary to Cecil Rhodes in South Africa.</p>

<p class='c016'>Sir Charles Dilke, M.P., took a flattering interest in my
books, and was very friendly in his intercourse with me.
The most amusing reminiscences I have in connection with
him are <i>à propos</i> of a dinner at which we were both taken in,
though I was too obscure for it to signify in my case.</p>

<p class='c016'>A dinner for a high-sounding object was given at Prince’s.
Sixty important public men and leading writers and journalists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>were invited, and Sir Charles Dilke was asked to respond
to the toast of the evening.</p>

<p class='c016'>His rising to speak was the signal for three great acetylene
flares to be turned on, which reduced the scores of electric
lights in the room to looking like the gas jets in the Richmond
railway-station. This was taken as a compliment to
Sir Charles, though it would have disconcerted any less
practised speaker.</p>

<p class='c016'>When his speech and the other speeches were over, the
chairman electrified the assemblage by informing them that
a new sort of gramophone would reproduce for them Tennyson’s
last words in the voice in which he spoke them. It was
a most impressive moment. For a few minutes one did not
realise the colossal impertinence of pretending that there had
been a phonograph in Tennyson’s bedroom on this solemn
occasion. But, of course, the record might have been produced
by a man who knew Tennyson’s voice well enough to
imitate it, as certain reciters imitate celebrated actors. We
did not realise this at the time. The next day the dinner was
duly reported, with the names of the makers of these wonderful
lamps, and this wonderful phonetic record, and later on
it transpired that these two parties had paid for the dinner,
which was only got up to advertise them.</p>

<p class='c016'>This is one of the two cleverest pieces of journalism I
remember. The other happened on the night that King
Edward died. A great London linen-draping firm had
an elaborate intelligence system during the well-beloved
monarch’s last illness. They were well served. I happened
to see the head of the firm about twelve hours before the
nation was plunged into mourning.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You may take it from me,” he said, “that his Majesty
won’t live another twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p class='c016'>As he was in the habit of making impressive statements,
I discounted what he said. But he was right, and acting on
his information, he bought up all the available mourning in
the market, and scored a huge business victory. I met him
long afterwards, and alluded to the information which he had
given me.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I wasn’t the only one who took pains to know,” he said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>“for that night, at the hour the King died, I was driving
from the hotel, where I had been dining, to my office, with
the correspondent of one of the great French newspapers.
As we passed the Palace, one of the top windows was opened,
and a person came to it with a lighted candle, and blew it
out. ‘Did you see that? Do you mind driving me to the
West Strand post-office?’ said my French friend. ‘Why,
no,’ I said; ‘but what do you want to go there for?’ ‘To
send a cipher-wire to my paper that his Majesty is dead.’
‘Isn’t it a great risk?’ I asked. ‘If it was, I would take it.
But even a good rumour is worth something.’”</p>

<p class='c016'>The Frenchman was right, and he won his victory.</p>

<p class='c016'>The late Lord Dufferin was another man who was very
kind to me about my writings. I suppose that they appealed
to him for the same reason that they appealed to Dilke.
Both of them were deeply interested in Greater Britain, and
in travel generally, and I have written books full of enthusiasm
for travel and the Colonies.</p>

<p class='c016'>Lord Dufferin never forgot any one who had served him.
When his new title forced a new signature on him, he sent
a new photograph with the Dufferin and Ava signature to
all his journalist friends, though some of them had passed
out of his sphere for years.</p>

<p class='c016'>He always did the right thing. I remember the late Lord
Derby beginning a speech at a dinner at Winnipeg at which
I was present, “As Lord Dufferin, who seems to have left
nothing unsaid, observed,” etc.</p>

<p class='c016'>On that same vice-regal progress to the West, I was
showing Lord Derby some Kodaks I had taken on various
occasions at which he had been present—crowded functions
in cities, full-dress rehearsals of Chippeway Indians on the
war-path, and the like. One print was from a negative
which I had of these Chippewas, with their necklaces of
cartridges and their feather head-dresses, taken on the top
of the massed choirs of Manitoba, singing “God save the
Queen.” Lord Derby begged this photograph from me,
“That’s a photograph of the whole trip,” he said.</p>

<p class='c016'>He remained surprisingly popular, considering the maladroitness
of one of his aide-de-camps—a delightful Guardsman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>who is now dead. I have heard this A.D.C., whom Nature
had gifted with the most graceful manners, say appalling
things.</p>

<p class='c016'>At one provincial capital, the mayor gave a ball in Lord
Derby’s honour. I had just been presented to the mayor,
and was standing quite close to him, when Lord Derby came
in. When the official presentation was over, Lord Derby,
who always wished to get on a friendly footing with his hosts,
asked his A.D.C. in a whisper, “What is the mayor, M——?”
The Governor-General wished to know if his host bred cattle,
or ran a timber-mill, or owned a hotel, or what, so that he
might say the appropriate thing. But the A.D.C.’s reply,
which, like Lord Derby’s “What is the mayor, M——?”,
was perfectly audible to that functionary, was “Toned-down
Jew.” So much for the <i>entente cordiale</i> at—we will
call it Medicine Hat.</p>

<p class='c016'>At a ball given by Lord Derby, I watched that same
A.D.C. taking an important politician, whom he should have
known perfectly well, to introduce him to his own wife, a
young and pretty woman who considered herself one of the
lions of Canadian society. The situation struck me as a
promising one, so I listened to hear what he would say.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Mrs. Um,” he said; “may I introduce Mr. Um-um to
you?” She looked up at him with an amused smile, and
he continued quite blissfully, “He’s a stupid old buffer, but
I’ll get you away from him as soon as I can.”</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXVI<br /> <br /><span class='c022'>MY TRAVELLER FRIENDS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Considering</span> the number of years which I have devoted
to travel, I have not met a great many explorers, certainly
nothing like so many as I should have met if I had been a
regular attendant at the meetings of the Royal Geographical
Society. These interest me extremely, but I have an unfortunate
habit of going to sleep at lectures, however interesting
I find them, so I shrink from going to them. Otherwise
I should have joined the society long ago, and been a regular
attendant.</p>

<p class='c016'>The last time I went there was many years ago, when a
great explorer and mighty hunter had just returned from
Mashonaland. He read an immensely interesting paper; I
quite forgot to go to sleep. Among the speakers who followed
was a pompous old gentleman, who scourged the
lecturer with the most inane platitudes, winding up with the
question, “May I ask the lecturer what he thinks of the
climate of Mashonaland?” and the explorer replied, “There’s
nothing wrong with the climate of Mashonaland, but it
isn’t the sort of place where you could get drunk and lie all
night in the gutter, without knowing about it the next
morning.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The old gentleman gasped, and so, I think, did the audience,
but the lecturer seemed quite unconscious that he had done
anything beyond giving sound advice.</p>

<p class='c016'>My friendship with the famous Dr. George Ernest Morrison,
of Peking, I have described in the chapter on Australians.
When I was living in Melbourne, I saw a good deal at the
Melbourne Club of Augustus Gregory, one of the doyens of
Australian exploration, actually the first, I believe, to accomplish
the transcontinental journey successfully. He told
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>me that when their supplies ran short, the things they missed
most in the terrific heat were fat and sugar. When their
water ran short, they more than once refilled their water-bottles
by wringing the dew out of their blankets.</p>

<p class='c016'>Curiously enough, fat and sugar were the things equally
most missed by a party of Canadian explorers who were
engaged one winter in finding the pass by which the Canadian
Pacific Railway crossed the Rocky Mountains. Their leader,
who was running a small steamer up from Golden City to
the source of the Columbia in Lake Windermere, told me
so, when I was a passenger with him. I had just shot a wild
goose on a shoal with my Winchester rifle from the deck of
the steamer, and he had come out of his cabin to see what the
matter was.</p>

<p class='c016'>I had a unique experience at that Canadian Lake Windermere.
I was lying flat on my back in the reedy shallows at
its edge, enjoying a bath in water above human temperature,
when a deputation of ranchers waited on me to ask if I would
act as judge in the annual horse-races for Red Indians,
which were to be held that afternoon. They had heard that
an author had come up with the steamer from Golden City,
and wished to pay me this unique compliment. I protested
my inexperience in the matter, but dressed and accompanied
them to a sort of pulpit made of fresh lumber, which I occupied
while half-a-dozen races were run on little barebacked horses
(I wondered if these were <i>mustangs</i>, but did not dare to show
my ignorance by inquiring) by naked braves and squaws
in trousers with a feather trimming down the seam.
As I escaped uninjured, I suppose that my judgments were
accepted. Colonel Baker, a brother of Valentine and Sir
Samuel, was one of the deputation.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the time of which I am writing, when people came back
from the wilds, it was the fashion to fête them at the literary
clubs. In this way I met Captain Lugard, who was fresh
back from his strenuous efforts in Uganda, and Mr. F. C.
Selous, when he came back from his pioneer expedition to
Mashonaland and Matabeleland, which led to their annexation,
and the foundation of Rhodesia. Selous was the
greatest hunter that England ever sent to South Africa.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>For twenty years he made his living as an elephant-hunter
and collector of rare natural history specimens, and took
the chief part in bringing about the annexation of Matabeleland.
In later days he has taken a great part in the measures
for preserving the wild animals of Africa by a splendid
system of game laws, far stricter than our own.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of all the author-explorers who came to Addison Mansions,
I have known none so well as Arnold Henry Savage Landor,
grandson of the poet Walter Savage Landor. I first met
Landor at Louise Chandler Moulton’s house in Boston, on
one Sunday night in 1888, when he was twenty years old,
and I have seen him constantly ever since. While we were
at Washington, as I have said elsewhere, he was my guest
for a week. We were at Montreal together one winter season,
and saw each other nearly every day, and when we got to
Japan, almost the first person we saw there was Landor.
We stayed in the same hotel there for months.</p>

<p class='c016'>When we first met Landor, he was an artist, who made
a considerable income by portrait-painting. It was not
until after we had met in Japan that he went upon his first
exploring expedition among the Hairy Ainu in the North
Island of Yezo and the Kuriles.</p>

<p class='c016'>After we left Japan, he went across to China, and went
very far afield in it. But he did not achieve world-wide
fame until he made his expedition into the Forbidden Land.
Every one has read of the tortures to which he was subjected
there, but it is not every one who met him on his way back,
as we did, when his spine was so injured that he could not sit
down, and his eyes still had a white film over them from
being bleared with fire. I knew of his endurance, because
I had seen him go out in Montreal in an ordinary English overcoat
and bowler when the thermometer was twenty-five below
zero; and I knew of his courage from the fracas he had with
the New York police when they were breaking the queue
at the Centenary Ball for people who gave them money to
get in out of their place, in which he came within an ace of
being clubbed.</p>

<p class='c016'>Landor is always witty. I heard him say to a man who
was bragging to him about the size of everything in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>country, “You see, I am so small that I have to come into
a room twice before any one can see me.”</p>

<p class='c016'>He is also extremely courageous. I once heard a dispute
between him and a man of six feet two, whose portrait he
was painting. While he was painting it, he did a small
commission for this man’s partner, who wanted it in a great
hurry as a wedding-present.</p>

<p class='c016'>“If you work for other people, I won’t have the portrait,”
said the giant.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You must have it,” said Landor.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Upon my word as a gentleman, <i>nothing</i> can make me
have it,” said the giant, whose name was B——.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Mr. B——,” said Landor, “nothing could make you
behave like a gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c016'>And his courage in taking other risks is just as great.</p>

<p class='c016'>Undismayed by his experiences in Thibet, he was back in
the Himalayas two years afterwards, and reached an altitude
of 23,490 ft. He was with the Allied troops on their march
to Peking, and was the first European to enter the Forbidden
City. He visited four hundred islands in the Philippines in
a Government steamer, lent him by the United States for
the purpose. He crossed Africa in the widest part, marching
8,500 miles to do it, and he crossed South America from
Rio de Janeiro in Brazil to Lima in Peru, over the great
central plateau, across the swamps of the Amazon and the
heights of the Andes, with followers selected from the most
desperate criminals in the gaols, because they were the only
Brazilians who would undertake the risk. That last journey
alone cost him seven thousand pounds. All Mr. Landor’s
books are illustrated with his own paintings and photographs.
It must be remembered that he was an artist before
he was an explorer or an author.</p>

<p class='c016'>Though he is contemptuous of hardships and semi-starvation
in his explorations, and travels with a lighter equipment
than any other explorer, he likes luxurious surroundings
when he is back in civilisation, and lives in a charming flat
in one of our most luxurious hotels.</p>

<p class='c016'>He also has a large estate in Italy, near Empoli and Vinci,
where he has carried on the wine-growing business very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>successfully. Landor’s mother is an Italian, and he himself
was born and educated at Florence, where his father, a younger
son of the celebrated Walter Savage Landor, has always
lived, and amassed a magnificent collection of works of art.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is not generally known that Landor was one of the
first to take up the invention of aeroplanes. He began long
before the Wrights, as long ago as 1893, when he succeeded
in flying a hundred yards, and later he built a more perfected
machine not unlike the ordinary aeroplanes. But he was
away, making his celebrated journeys across Africa and
South America while the invention advanced with such leaps
and bounds, and he abandoned aviation.</p>

<p class='c016'>Landor speaks many languages. He has lectured in
English, Italian, French, and German, before learned
societies, and he can speak several other European and
Oriental languages and many savage dialects. For he has
travelled all over the world, although the attention of the
public has been concentrated on the big journeys of exploration
which have formed the subjects of his books.</p>

<p class='c016'>Sir H. M. Stanley I only knew after he had retired from
exploring, and was living at Richmond Terrace, Whitehall.
I met him through having been a friend of his wife, who, as
Dorothy Tennant, was a leading figure in the most brilliant
set in London Society, and in so many altruistic movements.
I had met her brother, Charles Combe Tennant, when we
were both at Oxford—he at Balliol and I at Trinity. He
either proposed me or seconded me, I forget which, for the
Apollo, my other sponsor being J. E. C. Bodley, who was
both at Harrow and Balliol with Tennant. Bodley has since
become a very distinguished literary man. He is perhaps
the best writer we have upon French Constitutional questions,
and he was selected by the late King Edward VII to write
the book on the coronation, which involved a very wide
knowledge of the British Constitution.</p>

<p class='c016'>Lady Stanley wrote a book on London Street Arabs and
put together and edited an admirable autobiography of her
famous first husband, whose name she retains. Her sister
married Frederick Myers of Psychical fame, the greatest
Cambridge scholar of his generation.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>But it is not only the books she has written, and the
brilliant intellectual people whom she has gathered around
her, which constitute her claim to being remembered, for
she has taken a leading part in the betterment of London.
She has naturally worked hardest in Lambeth, where she
became acquainted with the swarming thousands of Surrey
when Stanley was member for one of the Lambeth Divisions,
and it was from Lambeth that she drew most of her boy-models
to make studies for her book illustrations of London
ragamuffins.</p>

<p class='c016'>Isabella Bird—Mrs. Bishop—one of the most famous
travellers in the East, I met once near Hakone in Japan.
She was a curious-looking old lady, dressed like a native
woman, with nothing but rope-sandals, which cost three-halfpence
a pair, on her feet. We came upon her very
suddenly, because Norma Lorimer and I had gone in to
examine the interior of a pretty building made of some light-coloured,
unpainted wood, into which people seemed to go
as they pleased. As Miss Lorimer was then not long out of
her teens, and the building proved to contain naked men and
women bathing together, only separated by a bamboo floating
on the top of the steaming pool, we came out much quicker
than we went in, and almost fell upon Isabella Bird and her
attendant.</p>

<p class='c016'>When we were at Khartum, the Sirdar, Sir Reginald
Wingate, introduced me to the famous Father Ohrwalder,
the good old Austrian priest who had made the sensational
escape from Omdurman twenty years before, and wrote the
extraordinarily vivid account of his captivity which is one
of our principal sources of knowledge of life in Omdurman.
He was then a venerable old man, with a patriarchal beard,
very frail, and exhausted by conversing for a few minutes,
but the Austrian Bishop, who spoke excellent English, took
his place, and we had an interesting conversation. He was
not, he informed me, allowed to make converts in the northern
part of the Sudan, where the inhabitants are chiefly Mohammedan.
I asked him if he made many converts among the
pagans in the southern part. He said not as many as he
ought, but I elicited from him that he set his face sternly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>against polygamy, and the Sirdar’s Intelligence officer had
informed us that one of the favourite forms of investment
in those provinces was to buy as many wives as you could
and make them work for you.</p>

<p class='c016'>Wingate himself was most kind to us during our visit to
the Sudan. He placed his three steamers or yachts at our
disposal, and deputed his Intelligence officer to accompany
us, whenever he had no actual need of him.</p>

<p class='c016'>The late John Ward, F.S.A., I never met on any of his
journeys to Egypt or the Sudan or Sicily, though we corresponded
for some years. I have found his books most
valuable. He had a perfect genius for collecting indispensable
illustrations, and his books are encyclopædias of local
colour.</p>

<p class='c016'>The late George Warrington Steevens, the finest correspondent
the <i>Daily Mail</i> ever had—it is said that they paid
him five thousand a year—a small, pale, delicate-looking
man, with double eye-glasses, and an alert, rather humorous
expression, used to come to us at Addison Mansions with
his wife. She was a good deal older than he was, but he
always said that she had been the making of his career, which
came to an untimely end while he was besieged in Ladysmith.</p>

<p class='c016'>His conversation was as sparkling as his journalism. I
remember when we were discussing Kitchener’s conquest
of the Sudan at the Authors’ Club one night, telling him
that Maxwell (now Sir John Maxwell, late commanding the
Army of Occupation in Egypt), who was one of Kitchener’s
most trusted officers, had been at Cheltenham College with
me.</p>

<p class='c016'>“What sort of man is Maxwell now?” I asked; and he
answered, “The sort of man you put in charge of a conquered
town.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Arthur Weigall, who was Inspector of Monuments in
Upper Egypt when we were there, came to see us several
times at Addison Mansions. One hardly expected to find
a member of the great Kent cricketing family one of the chief
experts in deciphering Egyptian inscriptions and judging
their antiquities. Weigall was rather superstitious for so
great an Egyptologist, though I confess that I should not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>have liked to outrage the dignity of the tomb of a queen at
Thebes, as he and a house-party he had at his fine mansion
on the river near Luxor, proposed to do. They got up
a sort of comedy to be performed in the tomb, and the
performance was blocked by a series of accidents—sudden
illness, the breaking of a leg, and so on.</p>

<p class='c016'>We had a delightful expedition with him to some of the
less-known tombs at Thebes. At his house I saw a couple
of articles he had published in <i>Blackwood’s Magazine</i> on
Aknaton, the heretic Pharaoh, and I think Queen Ti. I saw
at a glance that, like Sir Frederick Treves, he was a born
writer, with quite a Pierre Loti feeling for style, and learned,
to my surprise, that he had not been able to find a publisher
for two books which he had ready. I gave him a letter of
introduction to my literary agent, setting forth the circumstances,
which resulted in the instant acceptance of both
books by leading publishers. One of them was his admirable
<i>Guide to the Antiquities of Upper Egypt</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>Edward Ayrton, a most brilliant young Egyptologist,
who discovered the famous gold treasure in the tombs of the
Kings at Thebes, and has since been Government Archæologist
in Ceylon, we met at his lonely hut among the tombs
of the Kings. We came upon him the first time, dressed in
immaculate flannels, as if he was just starting off for a tennis
match, and playing <i>diavolo</i>. He is young enough to have
been at St. Paul’s with my son. It required a man of strong
nerve to live where he lived, surrounded by the spirits of
so many Egyptian monarchs and their great officers, and
practically at the mercy of any evilly-disposed Arabs. The
spirits of bygone Egyptians have, above all others, in the
history of psychical science, manifested their sustained
interest in human affairs. Ayrton was acting then, not for
the Government, but for a rich American.</p>

<p class='c016'>John Foster Fraser, who was my colleague on <i>To-day</i>,
though he is so much younger than I am, a remarkably able
and energetic man, who once went a bicycle tour of nearly
twenty thousand miles round the earth, and would have gone
farther if the land had not come to an end, has made many
long and adventurous journeys through dangerous countries,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>and has written notable books. The story I liked best about
his wanderings was that he always used the public tooth-brush,
provided by a civilised Shah who had been to Europe,
in the rest-houses of Persia. He certainly added that no
previous visitor to these rest-houses had ever known what
the brushes were used for.</p>

<p class='c016'>Speaking of teeth, I once knew a dentist who visited Persia.
Knowing the prestige of the royal family there, he thought
that his fortune was made, when the Shah and his mother
ordered sets of false teeth—the Shah’s made of pearls, I
think, and his mother’s of diamonds. But next day he was
overtaken by a crushing blow. The Shah, to prevent false
teeth from becoming too common, confined their use to the
royal family, and the poor dentist had to fall back on writing
novels—it was C. J. Wills.</p>

<p class='c016'>This Shah, or another, on his return from a visit to Europe,
made his entire harem adopt British ballet-girls’ skirts.</p>

<p class='c016'>This same Shah, when he visited London, asked the
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to recommend some one
to show him round the gilded hells of London. The man,
whose accomplishments thus received official recognition,
gave great satisfaction, I believe, but as he is still alive, I
shall not divulge his name, lest he should be overwhelmed
with overtures from publishers. His mother was a famous
Society hostess.</p>

<p class='c016'>I have known some Arctic and Antarctic explorers. I was,
as I have mentioned elsewhere, in the chair at the Savage
Club on the night that we entertained Nansen. Trevor-Battye,
who afterwards conducted an expedition to Kolguev
in the Barents Sea, himself, came up to me, asking me to
introduce him to Nansen. Of course, I had great pleasure
in doing so. Nansen, who was a tall, wiry man, and looked
much less at home in his dress-clothes and his Orders than
in his Arctic furs, looked my friend up and down. The
latter was a remarkably smart-looking man, and was very
well dressed. Nansen was not to know that he came of a
family famed for their strength and endurance in Indian
frontier warfare, so he said with a smile, which showed the
wide openings between his teeth in his lower jaw, “If you
come with me, remember that you won’t be able to wash for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>three years”—he meant, of course, after they had got to
the Arctic regions. Battye, who is a most distinguished
naturalist, and a well-known author, was not deterred, but
Nansen’s list was already really full. Battye was editor-in-chief
of Natural History in the Victoria History of the
Counties of England. At the Authors’ Club, where he was a
habitué in those days, we used to ask him why he had not
gone to the North Pole whenever we wanted to get a rise
out of him. He was a frequent visitor to our house.</p>

<p class='c016'>Another Arctic explorer who often came to see us after
he had got back from his three years in the Arctic circle, was
Fred Jackson, who conducted the Jackson-Harmsworth
expedition. Jackson was a very adventurous man. He had
made an expedition across the Great Tundra Desert, and
another across Australia, before he went to Franz Josef
Land. With his swarthy face, bright dark eyes, and general
air of <i>joie de vive</i>, Fred Jackson looks much more like the
manager of some great English business concern in the
Tropics than an Arctic explorer. Yet he was an Arctic
explorer, and a very hardy one. Everybody remembers
the photograph of the meeting of Nansen and Jackson in
the Arctic circle—Nansen swaddled to the chin in the fur
clothes of his kind, Jackson showing a starched English
collar, a proper tie, and a triangle of shirt-front.</p>

<p class='c016'>Back from the Arctic circle, Jackson volunteered for
South Africa, distinguished himself, won medals, and became
a captain in the Manchester Regiment—<i>Hac arte Pollux</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>We often had with us I. N. Ford, whose advent to England
as correspondent of the <i>New York Tribune</i> was practically
the beginning of the <i>entente cordiale</i> between Great Britain
and the United States. His predecessor, the well-known
G. W. Smalley, had been very much spoiled in English society,
but he never set himself whole-heartedly to produce hearty
relations between the two countries any more than Harold
Frederic did in his correspondenting in the <i>New York Times</i>.
<i>The Tribune</i>, had, in fact, been frequently in open hostility
to England—so open that I heard the following conversation
at a dinner-party in Washington in the year 1889 at Colonel
John Hay’s. General Harrison had just been elected President
of the United States, and the moderate Republicans
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>made no secret of the fact that they would have liked to see
Colonel John Hay, who had been Abraham Lincoln’s private
secretary, Harrison’s Secretary of State. His character stood
as high as any one’s in America; no man since George
Washington had been so fit to be President of the United
States; for he was as clear-headed and able and unwavering
as he was honourable, and his immense private wealth set
him above temptation. But it was that very wealth which
prevented him from being nominated. Americans are
determined that wealth shall not command the Presidency
as it has the Senate.</p>

<p class='c016'>Well, that night Savage Landor and I and a number of
leading American politicians—the men who were to form
Harrison’s Cabinet were most of them there—were dining
with Hay at his palatial mansion, built in a heavy-browed
sort of Spanish-Moresco style by the celebrated Richardson.
The new President’s private secretary, a commercialish little
Englishman, had promised to come, and he kept us waiting
so long that finally we went in to dinner without him, half-an-hour
late.</p>

<p class='c016'>At last he made his appearance, breathless, and, upsetting
a water-bottle as he took his seat, blurted out, “Whitelaw
Reid” (then editor and proprietor of the <i>Tribune</i>) “has been
moving heaven and earth to get the Court of St. James’”
(<i>i. e.</i> the post of American Minister to England), “but the
President won’t give it him. He’s afraid that England will
refuse to receive him because of the way in which the <i>Tribune</i>
has behaved.”</p>

<p class='c016'>A good many years later he achieved the goal of his
ambition, for I. N. Ford had come to England in the interval,
and had made the <i>Tribune</i> to America what the London
<i>Times</i> is to England in the matter of foreign politics. Ford
had won distinction earlier as an author writing on travel
in Central America.</p>

<p class='c016'>Another man who did a lot of spade-work in promoting
the <i>entente cordiale</i> was John Morgan Richards, who has lived
in England for many years, and has more than once been
President of the American Society of London. American
from his backbone to his finger-tips, John Richards had a
fine Quaker sense of justice and peace on earth which made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>the eagle lie down with the lion like a couple of lambs
wherever he was present. His brilliant daughter, Mrs. Craigie—better
known in literature as John Oliver Hobbes—was a
potent link between the two countries.</p>

<p class='c016'>Both he and his converse, G. R. Parkin, the Canadian,
who was the real father of Imperial Federation, and who is
now usefully and congenially employed in managing the
Rhodes Scholarship Fund, were often at our house. G. R.
Parkin and Gilbert Parker, another Canadian, were sometimes
confused with each other in those days, by people who
did not know them personally.</p>

<p class='c016'>Canada has sent us a lot of good men. Beckles Willson,
who lives in the old mansion in Kent which was the birthplace
of General Wolfe, the conqueror of Canada, has poured
out a stream of information about Canada in a most attractive
form. Who does not remember the elder Pitt asking Wolfe,
a boy of thirty-three, to dinner just after he had appointed
him to command the military in Canada? Wolfe got very
drunk, and for a moment Pitt feared that he had made a
mistake. But he remembered how the boy had behaved
under fire in that descent on the Breton coast, and let him
go to Canada without misgivings.</p>

<p class='c016'>I have known Seton Watson, the Perthshire Laird who has
done so much for the Slav population of Hungary, since he
was a small boy. When at New College, Oxford, he showed
his future bent by winning the Stanhope—the University
Prize for an historical essay. His first work, after he went
down, was to translate Gregorovius’s <i>Tombs of the Popes</i>.
But he soon began to give his attention to Hungary, where
he has travelled a great deal, and took up the cause of the
Slav races who are being oppressed by the Magyars. He
held a successful exhibition of their art in London a year or
two ago.</p>

<p class='c016'>Another friend of mine who has done similar good
work is Campbell Mackellar. He, however, has chiefly
devoted himself to the Balkans, and in Montenegro no Englishman
is so well known and beloved. At his hospitable table
I have met some of the leading representatives of the Balkan
States who came to England during the war.</p>

<p class='c016'>Connected both by property and family with Australia, his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>book-writing has been chiefly about Australia, and it was
he who wrote the description of the Adam Lindsay Gordon
country in South Australia which appears in the book I
wrote with Miss Humphris about <i>Adam Lindsay Gordon and
His Friends in England and Australia</i>. Mackellar has likewise
done a good deal for the recognition of Australian Art in
London—a fact commemorated in an album of original
sketches presented to him by the Australian artists who are
over here.</p>

<p class='c016'>It was no mere accident which made Miss Humphris and
myself collaborate in <i>Adam Lindsay Gordon and His Friends
in England and Australia</i>. It was true that we were strangers
when she wrote to ask me to collaborate, but we brought
common traditions to bear on the book. In Cheltenham,
where Gordon spent his boyhood, Miss Humphris lives, and
I was six years at the College. Gordon was a College boy,
and his father was a College master. Miss Humphris could
not be at the College, as I was, but her grandfather was the
architect who built its principal buildings. Like Gordon,
both Miss Humphris and I went to Australia, and we spent
years there, though not so many as he did, and as a connection
of one of Australia’s greatest racing men—the famous
Etienne de Mestre—it was natural that she should take an
absorbing interest in the steeplechasing exploits of Adam
Lindsay Gordon.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>SIR GILBERT PARKER<br /><i>Drawn by Yoshio Markino</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c016'>Edith Humphris has an extraordinary power of collecting
and sifting materials for a book. Off her own bat, she
collected all the facts of Gordon’s early life at Cheltenham
and Prestbury. The grist which I brought to the mill,
besides a study of Gordon’s life in Australia and his poems,
which I had blocked out more than thirty years before, when
I tried to get Cassell’s to undertake its publication, was the
mass of material put at my disposal by people who had known
him in the flesh, and treasured remembrances and keepsakes
of him. Miss Humphris knew that the letters to Charley
Walker existed; I tracked their owner down and got permission
to reproduce them. Henry Gyles Turner, who gave
me leave to use all the materials in <i>Turner and Sutherland</i>,
was a friend of mine in Australia. George Riddoch, who
gave us all the Riddoch poems and reminiscences, is a friend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>of mine, introduced by old friends in Australia. Lambton
Mount, Gordon’s partner on the West Australian Station
(brother of Harry Mount), is a friend of mine, and gave me
all his information orally. General Strange, who was
Gordon’s friend at Woolwich, and wrote about him in <i>Gunner
Jingo’s Jubilee</i>, is an old, old friend of mine. Frederick
Vaughan and Sir Frank Madden and Mrs. Lauder wrote
their reminiscences for me, as did Campbell Mackellar of the
Gordon country in South Australia. And John Bulloch,
the editor of the <i>Graphic</i>, who wrote the wonderfully interesting
pedigrees and chapters about Gordon’s family, wrote
them for me.</p>

<p class='c016'>But Miss Humphris wrote all her part of the book, including
a great deal about Gordon in Australia, herself, from
studies which she had been making since she was a child.</p>

<p class='c016'>Talking of Australia, at one time I saw a good deal of
Basil Thomson, the son of the great Archbishop of York, who
in those days was an author, but is now secretary of the
Prison Commission, after having been governor of Dartmoor
and Wormwood Scrubbs prisons.</p>

<p class='c016'>Thomson, when I first knew him, had just come back
from being Prime Minister of the Tonga Islands. I asked
why he gave it up. He said that things were no longer what
they had been in Government circles in Tonga; when he was
there, even the Government could only raise the wind by
having fresh issues of postage stamps manufactured for them
by stamp-dealers in England, who paid for the privilege of
selling the stamps in England without accounting for them
to the Government of Tonga. But in the palmy days of
Tonga it was very different. Then, a Prime Minister, who
was also a Nonconformist missionary, procured the monopoly
of selling trousers from the King of Tonga, before he induced
the king to make the whole population turn Christian, and
make it illegal to appear without trousers.</p>

<p class='c016'>You sometimes hear people say, “What would you do if
you were on a desert island?” I once came very near
seeing life on a desert island—it was in a little settlement of
less than a dozen families, on an island adjoining the mainland
on a desolate coast of Asia. It had a Consul.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It seems an awfully dead and alive hole,” I said to him.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>“It is not so bad as it looks,” he replied. “We have a
splendid rule here; as there is no kind of amusement in the
place, except making love, we passed a resolution that no
one should get in a temper over the infidelity of a spouse.
We manage our loves like other people manage their friendships—if
a woman likes to have an affair with another
woman’s husband, it is nobody’s concern but hers and his.
Since we have made this arrangement, this has been the
happiest place in the world, though we live on a mud bank,
without even a tennis-court. Before this golden age began,
the quarrelling was awful. Two men simply could not get
out of each other’s way, and they felt obliged to resort to
violence to maintain their self-respect, though they might not
value the affection they were losing so much as an old glove.”
I forget the profession of the Solon to whom the community
owed this up-to-date method of law-giving.</p>

<p class='c016'>Fred Villiers, the war-correspondent, was making his way
across Canada at the same time as we were, on a lecture tour.
He had a number of wonderful battle-slides, and he looked
highly picturesque in his service kit. He had also a splendid
advance agent, whom I will only call by his Christian name,
because he was the son of an English bishop, and had very
distinguished connections. Henry never forgot his dignity,
and even in the wilds of the North-West always wore a tall
silk hat, with its fur worn thin by constant brushing, because
he was Villiers’ agent.</p>

<p class='c016'>We had run across him at many C.P.R. capitals before he
came to our rescue at a woe-begone place called Kamloops
in British Columbia. We arrived there after midnight, and
proceeded to the hotel, which should have been expecting us,
as it was the only train in the day from Montreal. We found
the hotel open, but absolutely deserted. We could have
helped ourselves to anything we liked in the bar, and taken
our choice of the bedrooms. At that moment appeared
Henry, who asked us what we would like to drink, and told
us the Kamloops charges for it. He then took us round,
and gave us our choice of bedrooms, and when we wanted to
know why he had suddenly become landlord, told us that the
landlord had just died, and the Irish servants were afraid
to be in the house with a corpse.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>We slept the night there, and paid our bills to Henry in
the morning. Norma Lorimer, who was with us, had a room
which smelt horribly of disinfectants. Henry said that the
dentist, who came up once a week from Seattle, had used
that room as his surgery the day before, but the inhabitants
said that the corpse was there.</p>

<p class='c016'>This was nothing to an experience of Lewis Clarke, a
son of the celebrated Marcus Clarke, who wrote <i>For the Term
of his Natural Life</i>, and edited the first complete edition
of Adam Lindsay Gordon’s poems—a man who has had an
extraordinarily adventurous life. This happened to him,
I think, in the wilds of New Guinea. He had gone to sleep
under a tree. During the night there came on a violent wind,
and he was awakened by something cold and heavy, which
kept brushing his face. Whatever it was, it only just
touched him, and when he brushed it away, yielded lightly
to his touch. After pushing it away for a while, he came to
the conclusion that it did not matter, and got to sleep again.
In the morning he was awakened by an awful stench, and
when he opened his eyes to see what it was, found the bare
toes of a dead Chinaman, who had hanged himself, knocking
against his nose.</p>

<p class='c016'>When I was at Canton, I went to visit our Consul-General
there. I was with him in his office one day when he was
trying a case. An Englishman had gone out shooting, and
a Chinaman had sent his children after him, with instructions
to get into the line of fire and be shot, which duly happened.
The affectionate father then brought an action against the
Englishman for damages occasioned to him by the injuries
to his children. It was perfectly plain that the children
had had themselves shot on purpose, but to my utter surprise
the Consul made the Englishman pay.</p>

<p class='c016'>When the parties had left the room, I reproached him with
the miscarriage of justice. His only reply was, “I know it,
my dear fellow, as well as you do; but I have been Consul
here for thirty years (I forget exactly how many he said), and
it is impossible for me to conceive any circumstances under
which the British Government would support me.”</p>

<p class='c016'>I may add that he was much loved and respected by the
British community, whom he was unable to protect.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXVII<br /> <br /><span class='c022'>MY ACTOR FRIENDS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Since</span> I came back to London a score of years ago, I have
known at least a hundred actors and actresses, but they did
not all visit us at Addison Mansions—some, whom I knew
quite well, never could summon up the energy to go as far
west as West Kensington. Actors like to live right in the
centre of things, or right out in country air. There is quite
a colony of them at Maidenhead; Maxine Elliot lives near
Watford, in the Manor House which belonged to my uncle
Joseph, and Edward Terry had a house at Barnes, which is
now sublimed into Ranelagh Parade.</p>

<p class='c016'>Among our chief actor friends were the Grossmiths.
Weedon Grossmith, with his pretty wife, came constantly.
That diffident manner of his hides brilliant abilities. We
are apt to forget that besides being one of the finest comedians
of the day, he was once a regular exhibitor at the Royal
Academy (which furnished him with the subject for a farce).
What has made Weedon so “immense” is his absence of
<i>mauvais honte</i>. He has dared to play the humiliating parts,
of which he is the finest living exponent, with perfect sincerity.
He has often said to me, “Why don’t you write me
a play, Douglas? If you make me a bally enough little
fool, I’ll take it; if you make me a big enough coward, I’ll
take it; if you make me a bad enough cad, I’ll take it. It is
my art to put this kind of character into the pillory.” And
so it is; there is no one who can excel him in depicting the
ignoble, foreign as it is to his own character.</p>

<p class='c016'>His brother George, with his wife and daughters and his
son Lawrence—George the younger had already flitted from
the paternal nest, and was earning forty pounds a week—were
also constant visitors. Lawrence was always the mirror
of smartness. I think he was very bored with that sort of
party, but he adorned it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>Geegee, as he loved to call himself, was full of frolic.
He could make light of anything. He made light of the
awful play in which he appeared, which was written for the
mistress of a millionaire. The author was given five thousand
pounds to write a play and put it on the stage. The only
condition was that the millionaire’s mistress should be on
the stage the whole time, and have nothing to say.</p>

<p class='c016'>He was once the cause of my seeing the finest piece of
acting off the stage which I ever saw. One of our greatest
living actors is always chaffed about his <i>penchant</i> for duchesses.
Grossmith and I were having supper together by ourselves
at his party at the Grafton Galleries. Presently we saw the
great actor standing beside us, and Grossmith, without
bothering about his being within earshot, said, “We’ll ask
—— to sit down and have some supper with us; when he’s
been there about two minutes, he’ll look at his watch, and say
that he must leave us because he promised to be at the
duchess’s in a quarter of an hour.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The great man sat down and attacked a mayonnaise vigorously.
Presently he looked at his watch, and made an
elaborate and rather snobbish apology to Grossmith for having
to leave, but he had promised the Duchess of ——d, etc.,
and all the time he was making it, trod on my foot till I
nearly yelled. Then he got up and left us, pausing to speak
to some one a few yards off to have the satisfaction of hearing
Grossmith’s “There, didn’t I tell you!”</p>

<p class='c016'>Fred Terry, the “manliest actor on the stage,” and his
beautiful wife, Julia Neilson, used to come and see us sometimes.
I met them first at Hayden Coffin’s, where she was
filling the room and the garden with her glorious singing
one summer dawn. When she rose from the piano, she made
several vain efforts to get Terry away; he was telling Coffin,
myself, and one or two others, some of his experiences.
When she came back the third time, he said, “My wife always
has a devil of a trouble to make me put on my dress-clothes,
but when I have once got them on, I never want to go home.”</p>

<p class='c016'>That night, a rather shy little man, very alert and intelligent-looking,
had given us a recitation of his own which was
so breathlessly witty, that the audience could not seize all
the points. Coffin introduced him as “a very clever friend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>of mine, Mr. Huntley Wright,” and his name meant nothing
to the audience. A year later they would have stood on the
mantelpiece to get a better view of the king of musical
comedians. Both he and his sister Haidée, that brilliant
character-actress, used to come to Addison Mansions in those
days. That the Coffins should do so was natural, because I
had known Charles Hayden Coffin since he was a boy at school
and I was a man at Oxford. He and his sisters and I and
my sisters used to skate together at Lillie Bridge. His father
was the leading American dentist of London, and Coffin himself
was a dentist, or, at all events, in training for it, for
several years. But he had such a glorious voice that it was
inevitable that he should find his way to the musical stage,
and have the longest reign on record as a <i>jeune premier</i>.
He thrilled London with his “Queen of My Heart To-night.”
He has deserved his success twice over—both on account of his
singing, and for the way in which he has helped others; no one
has done more for the beginners in his own profession, and for
helping unknown composers of ability to get a hearing. There
are many people quite famous now whom I heard before they
were known to fame at all, at his charming cottage, that <i>rus
in urbe</i> on Campden Hill, which has the same initials as himself—C.
H. C., Campden Hill Cottage, Charles Hayden Coffin.</p>

<p class='c016'>With Julia Neilson I should have mentioned her handsome
cousin, Lily Hanbury, who was, till her premature death, one
of the beauties of the London stage. She came often to us.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is natural, in connection with her, to think of Constance
Collier, now Mrs. Julian L’Estrange, who filled her place, and
has gone so much farther, for she has not only personal
attraction, but real power. She was, as all the world knows,
leading lady at His Majesty’s before she went to America,
but all the world does not know that she is the most accomplished
tango-dancer on the stage.</p>

<p class='c016'>There is no more attractive figure on the stage than Ben
Webster. Young as he is, he found time to be a barrister
before he began his long succession of leading parts, and
though he is one of the least stagey actors on the stage, he
was born in its purple. He is a grandson of Ben Webster I.,
who had a claim to fame besides his acting which has long
since been forgotten, for he was the founder of the great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span><i>Queen</i> newspaper, which he sold to Sergeant Cox—strange
godfathers for the <i>Queen, the Lady’s Newspaper</i>. Sergeant
Cox was the uncle, not the father, of Horace Cox, who was
at the head of the <i>Field</i>, the <i>Queen</i>, and the <i>Law Times</i> for
most of the last half century. Webster married an actress,
May Whitty, so well known, not only for her acting, but for
her activity in woman movements. They were very often at
Addison Mansions, and among the strongest supporters of
our Argonauts Club.</p>

<p class='c016'>Lena Ashwell we have known better than any other great
actress, because we came to know her family long before she
went on the stage, through her sister, Mrs. Keefer, wife of
the engineer who built the famous bridge over Niagara.
In those days she was studying at the Royal Academy of
Music, and she is an F.R.A.M. She has a singularly beautiful
voice for singing as well as speaking. Conscious of the
burning dramatic temperament which won her her fame in
the impersonation of the heroine in <i>Mrs. Dane’s Defence</i>,
she has always cast her eyes on the stage. When she was
only fourteen she spoiled a chicken she was cooking by
forgetting to remove the insides because she was so enthralled
with reading <i>King John</i>. In intensity she is unsurpassed by
any actress on the stage. She is really as good in tender
parts as in grim parts, but she is less known in them, though
every one should remember how delightful she was in <i>The
Darling of the Gods</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>Lena Ashwell enjoys the almost unique distinction of having
been born on a British man-of-war, the fine old ship which
did duty under Nelson, and was the Wellesley training-ship
till she was accidentally burnt a few months ago. Her
father was a captain in the Navy.</p>

<p class='c016'>Having been brought up in Canada on the St. Lawrence,
she is a wonderful canoeist. Her grace on the water used to
be the theme of the frequenters of Cookham Reach.</p>

<p class='c016'>Her brother, Roger Pocock, has written the best novels
of the Canadian North-West. They are descendants of the
famous traveller, and had a great-great-uncle, Nicholas
Pocock, the sea-painter who painted Nelson’s Battle of the
Nile and Lord Howe’s Glorious First of June. Another
ancestor wrote farces in the reign of Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>Lena Ashwell owns the Kingsway Theatre, and has produced
some notable successes there, in which she showed her
determination to give brilliant beginners—whether actors or
dramatists—a chance. But since 1908, when she married
Dr. Simson of Grosvenor Street, she has chiefly given herself
up to feminist and benevolent movements—the chief of which
was the founding of the Three Arts’ Club for young actresses,
musicians, and painters to make their home as well as their
club. The Three Arts’ Club has an excellent magazine of
its own, and confers the various advantages of an Institute
on its members. She is also a prominent worker for the
Suffrage Movement.</p>

<p class='c016'>One of the earliest of our actor friends, and one of our
most frequent visitors, was James Welch, who first came
with his brother-in-law, Le Gallienne. He had given up
chartered-accounting for the stage for five or six years before
we knew him. But a good many years more had to pass
before he came into his own as the genius of farce, though
he played with real power and success in several of Ibsen’s
plays, and Bernard Shaw’s first play, <i>Widowers’ Houses</i>. It
was in <i>Mr. Hopkinson</i>, in 1905, after he had been on the stage
for eighteen years, that he became an idol of the public,
and was enabled to go into management.</p>

<p class='c016'>Ever since then he has been enormously successful, and
in spite of it, has remained the same simple, impulsive,
unspoiled person as ever. He used often, as I have told in
another chapter, to go to the Authors’ Club with me.</p>

<p class='c016'>One night not long since, when I was chatting with him
in his dressing-room at the theatre, and was asking him when
he could have another game of golf, he said, “I don’t know,
I’m sure. I have contracts with cinema-film photographers
for seven thousand pounds, and I don’t see how the devil
I am going to get them all in.”</p>

<p class='c016'>I felt quite oppressed with the unfairness of things, for I
had known this same man when he was just as brilliant an
actor, eating his head off with chagrin at not being able to
get an engagement (of which I am sure he was badly in need
pecuniarily), and now here were photographers and film-makers
tumbling over each other in their anxiety to take him
in his inimitable fooling in <i>When Knights were Bold</i>, or his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>misery and stupefaction in his great condemned cell-scene from
the Coliseum.</p>

<p class='c016'>Welch is quite a decent golfer—down to 8, I think,
though the time was when I had to give him 8. He is
also a remarkably good spinner of golf stories. I tell him
that whenever he is hard up for a curtain-raiser, he could
easily hold a house for half-an-hour with his golf-stories.</p>

<p class='c016'>One of his favourites is about his caddie at Aberdeen,
to whom he gave two seats to see him in <i>When Knights were
Bold</i>. Next day on the links, he asked the man how he
liked it.</p>

<p class='c016'>“My wife laughed,” said the cautious Scot.</p>

<p class='c016'>“And what did you think of it?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Oh, I? Now tell me, mon, do you make a guid thing
of it?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I do pretty well.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ye do?” said the caddie. “Then my advice to ye is,
to drop golf—ye’ll never make a living at that.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mrs. Welch is a daughter of Lottie Venne, one of the best
women comedians we ever had on the English stage—a
frequent visitor to us at one time, as was that fine actress,
Fanny Brough (Mrs. Boleyn), an eminent member of an
eminent family, whom we first met at an Idler tea.</p>

<p class='c016'>At the Idler, too, we met the Beringers, of whom we saw
a good deal at that time—Mrs. Oscar Beringer, the playwright,
and her daughters Esme and Vera, who were both
on the stage. Vera, the younger, has followed in her mother’s
footsteps, and written plays—one with Morley Roberts. Esme,
who is very popular both as a woman and an actress, has
played in a large number of parts with an unvarying success.</p>

<p class='c016'>We knew Beatrice (Robbie) Ferrar much better than
either of her sisters, though all three came to our at-homes,
just as they were all three on the stage. Though she had been
on the stage six years when we met her, she still looked a
mere child. She was for years one of the best <i>ingénue</i>
actresses (for which her pretty, small features, bright colouring
and demure expression, gave her natural advantages)
on the stage. She was one of the most familiar figures at
the Idler functions.</p>

<p class='c016'>Rowena Jerome, who has scored several successes in her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>father’s plays, was only a little child, playing horses, remarkably
clever and precocious, in the days when we were
going to the Idler teas and Jerome’s house in the Alpha
Road, St. John’s Wood.</p>

<p class='c016'>Among other actors and actresses we met at the Idler teas
or at Jerome’s were Ian (Forbes) Robertson and his wife,
and their daughter, Beatrice Forbes-Robertson, Nina Boucicault,
the Henry Arthur Jones’s, Kate and Mary Rorke, Olga
Nethersole, George Hawtrey, Lindo and Phyllis Broughton.
I saw Phyllis Broughton the other day, looking absolutely
the same as the very first time she ever came to our flat,
twenty years ago, the gentlest-faced actress I ever met.</p>

<p class='c016'>Forbes-Robertson’s brother, Ian Robertson (who never
used the name of Forbes himself, though his pretty daughter
Beatrice resumed it when she went on the stage), came to
us less frequently than his wife and daughter, who were
habituées.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mrs. Robertson was a daughter of an old friend of mine,
that remarkable man Joe Knight, who always seemed to
me as if he ought to have been Henty’s brother. As dramatic
critic of three leading newspapers, the <i>Athenæum</i>, the <i>Globe</i>,
and I forget the other, he had almost as much power to make
and unmake as Clement Scott had. He used his influence
most generously. At the same time he was a scholar of
omniscience; he performed the Herculean task of editing
<i>Notes and Queries</i> for the proprietors of the <i>Athenæum</i>; and
he had a daughter so good-looking and charming that I
always thought of her as Romola when I thought of her with
him. I have no doubt that before she married Ian Robertson
she had made herself as useful to the scholar as Romola.</p>

<p class='c016'>Their daughter, Beatrice, has made a distinguished name
for herself on the American stage.</p>

<p class='c016'>It was an odd thing that I should not have met (Sir J.)
Forbes-Robertson at Jerome’s, considering how much they
have done since to make each other’s fortunes in the <i>Third
Floor Back</i>, for which Jerome, as he always does when I
am in England, sent me stalls on one of the opening nights.
But, as a matter of fact, I met Forbes-Robertson at Palermo
in the Venetian palace which Joshua Whitaker, the head of
the great Marsala wine-firm, built for himself, adjoining the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>old Ingham house in the Via Bara. Forbes-Robertson was
staying there, and I am in and out of the Whitakers most
days when I am in Palermo. He was convalescing from a
severe illness, and we went about, the little which he could
manage, together in Sicily, and afterwards for a whole week
together in Venice.</p>

<p class='c016'>He was, I remember, very tickled with one trip which he
took in Sicily when he got stronger. A nephew who lives
in England, but has very large possessions in Sicily, came
out to stay with the Whitakers. They wished him to visit
his various properties in the interior when he was there.
But the thing did not interest him; he was a subaltern in
the Guards, taken up with much more important thoughts.
But he was an ardent admirer of Forbes-Robertson on the
stage, and he was willing to go wherever his uncle desired
if Forbes-Robertson would go with him.</p>

<p class='c016'>Forbes-Robertson was eager to oblige his hosts, and
captivated with the manner of the expedition, for, as they
were going into brigandy parts of the island, and the person
of a great landowner is the favourite prey of the brigand,
they had to have an escort, and sit with loaded revolvers on
their knees.</p>

<p class='c016'>Everything passed off happily, and Forbes-Robertson
came back with the knowledge that an orchard in which
pistachio trees bear freely is as good as a gold-mine.</p>

<p class='c016'>In Venice he was quite well again, and spent all day in
letting us show him the <i>artist’s bits</i> of Venice, for there was
a time when, like another of our leading actors, he expected
to make his living as a painter, not as an actor. He was
educated at the Royal Academy till he was twenty-one,
after leaving the Charterhouse, where he was four years the
senior of Baden-Powell.</p>

<p class='c016'>He was especially delighted with the gondola expeditions
we made to the back canals of Venice. One day it would
be along by the lagoon, where the timber-rafts lie floating,
and collect weeds and local colour, past the ruining abbey
of the Misericordia and Tintoretto’s Church, S. Maria del
Orto, to Tintoretto’s house, now woefully humiliated by
being a “tenement,” but unrepaired and unaltered since
that prince of painters lived and worked in it. It may easily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>be found, since it is near the Camel sign of a mediæval Moorish
merchant. Another day it would be across the Giudecca,
where the big Adriatic fishing-boats, with figures of saints
and monsters on their scarlet and orange sails lie anchored,
generally with their sails flapping against their masts, as
if they knew that they were there for ornament to the landscape.
Across the Giudecca there was the famous Redentore
Church, with its three far-famed Madonnas by the pupils of
Bellini, and there was more than one house with that rarity
for Venice—a garden.</p>

<p class='c016'>Over the other side of the Giudecca we all went into the
great old garden of some Marchese. Venice has gardens
there, but the Venetians are so unused to gardens that they
abandon them to dull evergreens, when, having nothing to
overshadow them, they might be as full of gay flowers as a
sarcophagus in Raphael’s pictures of the Resurrection. The
only person I know who does make use of his garden chances
is Dr. Robertson, the Presbyterian Minister, who wrote that
wonderful book, <i>The Bible of St. Mark’s</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>I think Forbes-Robertson enjoyed the visit to Tintoretto’s
house best of all. The well-head in the court was untouched
except by the soft fingers of three centuries; the studio, with
its open timber roof and huge fireplace, had nothing about
it to distract the eye from memories, for it was a bare tenement
of the poor. And it was such a very little way from
S. Maria del Orto, a name made classic to the British public
by the robbery of one of the most precious Madonnas of
John Bellini—Santa Maria del Orto, which contains a frescoed
choir by Tintoretto, and his “Presentation in the Temple,”
and his tomb. When we were looking at the immortal
Venetian pictures in the Accademia and the Doge’s Palace,
or studying the faded marbles which jewel the interior of
St. Mark, he was so overcome with reverence that it seemed
almost a pain to him. He had not, I think, been in Venice
before. At all events, he did not know it as I did—I could
take him to any point of interest in the city by a few minutes’
walk, and perhaps crossing the Grand Canal by a traghetto.
I have written half a book about Venice, and some of my best
writing is about it. I do not know why I never finished it.</p>

<p class='c016'>Henry Arthur Jones’s family I have known since they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>were children. Mrs. Jones used to come to our parties before
the eldest of her children was out of the schoolroom, and we
spent one summer in the same house at Ostend, so we have
watched the elder girls coming to the front on the stage with
interest. Of the great dramatist himself I have spoken
elsewhere. If he had chosen, he could have been equally
famous as a writer of books. He has a profound mind, and
a popular method of statement.</p>

<p class='c016'>Olga Nethersole could not come in the evenings to our
at-homes, because she was generally acting, but she came for
long talks in the afternoons. I found her remarkable, not
only as an actress of a singularly emotional type, but from
the interest which she takes in the social problems of the day,
such as criminology and emigration. A year ago, at a party
given by the C. N. Williamsons at the <i>Savoy</i>, when we were
comparing notes on the Canadian North-West, from which
she had just returned, and which I knew twenty years ago,
I was much struck by her grasp of the subject.</p>

<p class='c016'>I cannot remember whether it was at the Idler or at “John
Strange Winter’s” that I first met Martin Harvey, who, like
Forbes-Robertson, is a painter in his leisure moments. He
was with Irving in those days, recognised already as the
most capable all-round actor in the company, and for his
wonderful conscientiousness and finish. Harvey had the
good sense to bide his time, and when he did launch on his
own account in <i>The Only Way</i>, which Frederick Langbridge,
the poet, dramatised in collaboration from Dickens’s
<i>Tale of Two Cities</i>, he made an instantaneous and gigantic
success. In the days when he used to come to us, he was
singularly boyish-looking, and delightfully modest about
his powers, though all his friends knew that he was a genius.</p>

<p class='c016'>It was certainly “John Strange Winter” who introduced
us to Mary Ansell, at that time one of the twin stars of
Barrie’s first play, <i>Walker, London</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>It may have been Mary Ansell, who was noted for her
beauty, who introduced us to the other star of the play,
Irene Vanbrugh, equally noted for her prettiness and her
archness, who continues to this day to interpret the whimsicalities
of Barrie with such delightful <i>espièglerie</i>. She was a
Miss Barnes, daughter of a Prebendary of Exeter—there were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>four daughters living with their mother in Earl’s Court Road.
Violet, the eldest, and Irene, the youngest, then unmarried,
were on the stage, Angela was a violinist or violoncellist—I
never remember which of these instruments my friends
play—and Edith, the fair one of the family, frowned on the
stage, and married somebody of importance in India. Angela
came to us oftenest. A little later Violet Vanbrugh married
Arthur Bourchier, whom I had met long before when he
was at Christchurch, Oxford, and the leading light of the
Oxford A.D.C., of which Alan MacKinnon, an old friend of
mine at Trinity, who introduced us, was another leading
light.</p>

<p class='c016'>Bourchier, the inimitable, is, I fancy, the only professional
Shakesperian actor who could have the chance of taking the
part of one of his own family in Shakespeare. For Cardinal
Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbury, is a character in
Shakespeare’s <i>Richard III</i>. He was also Henry VI’s
Chancellor, as Sir Robert de Bourchier was to Edward III
in 1340—the first of the lay-Chancellors of England.</p>

<p class='c016'>The first time I saw Bourchier act was when he was an
undergraduate at Oxford—the part was Harry Hotspur,
and he was superb in it, because this was a part in which he
could use his art and his personality in equal proportions.
Since then I have seen him blend his two great qualifications
of character-acting and potent personality, in many parts,
in Henry VIII pre-eminently, and I have seen him exercise
the two qualifications separately in many parts, now as an
old seventeenth-century Bishop, overflowing with goodness,
now as a bluff, practical joker in boisterous farce with
Weedon Grossmith. He is certainly one of the finest actors
on the stage, when you consider him from the double standpoint
of his tremendous personality, and his power to disguise
it in parts entirely foreign to one’s idea of Bourchier. I
cannot help liking him best as himself on the stage, because
to me there is nothing so interesting as personality, and he
has such an inexhaustible flow of wit and high spirits.</p>

<p class='c016'>If Bourchier had had no success on the professional stage,
his name would have been immortalised in its annals, for
it was he who persuaded Jowett, of Balliol, the then Vice-Chancellor
of Oxford, to abolish the statute of the University
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>against Oxford having a theatre, and he actually enlisted
Jowett’s services into raising the money for building one.</p>

<p class='c016'>When I first went to Oxford, we had no theatre on account
of the famous statute. Our ancestors regarded actors as
“rogues and vagabonds,” and only a year ago a well-known
actor got off serving on a jury on the grounds that he was
legally a rogue. But though the town might not have a
theatre, it might have as many low music-halls as it liked,
because the University did not consider what went on in
“the halls” as acting at all. The real point at issue—would
the ladies of a caste like Irving’s or Tree’s be as likely
to tempt the St. Anthonys of Oxford out of their hermitages
in the deserts of learning—was entirely lost sight of.</p>

<p class='c016'>With Bourchier one naturally thinks of Aubrey Smith,
who had to play Sir Marcus Ordeyne in Bourchier’s theatre—Smith,
who was the chief light of the Cambridge A.D.C., and
the crack Cambridge bowler of his time in the ’Varsity matches.</p>

<p class='c016'>Smith’s beautiful sister, Mrs. Cosmo Hamilton, who
latinised her name into <i>Faber</i> when she went on the stage—she
told me so herself—was only just coming into her own
when she died—cut off in her very flower. There was no
more genuinely liked and esteemed woman on the stage.</p>

<p class='c016'>Granville Barker, the typical clever, red-headed boy,
though he was not then old enough to have been promoted to
dress-clothes, used to come with an extremely intelligent and
charming mother, the mother of a large family, I always
understood, though she looked far too young. They were
brought by Edwin Waud, the artist, as far as I remember, and
they were friends of Gleeson White’s. Granville was a very
bright boy when you spoke to him, but he was never much in
evidence; he left his mother, so that she might enjoy herself,
instead of having to keep him amused. He may have gone
to the sandwiches and lemonade in the dining-room—more
probably, he was not allowed to smoke, and went to do that.</p>

<p class='c016'>I fancy that Acton Bond, who now runs the British
Empire Shakespeare Society, must have been a friend of
Gleeson White’s, because he came into our life so very early.
Bond was an institution in Bohemia. He was a singularly
handsome and distinguished-looking actor, who took Shakespeare
and other “costume” parts. He was one of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>most courteous men I ever met, and I knew that I could
confer pleasure on anybody by introducing Bond. This was
an important consideration to a host who made a point of
keeping all his guests introduced and amused for all the
evening. Bond knew all the denizens in Bohemia, and had
a fund of conversation about them, in addition to being
personally very interesting; and, as a fair golfer, a good man
in a boat, a good dancer, and so on, was a “find” for a
country house. Even when he was acting most, his heart
inclined to the other side of his profession—to training people
for the stage and running the Actors’ Association—a sort
of Union for Actors. He did an immense amount of useful
work. He married the charming Eve Tame comparatively
lately. A tall man, with a graceful figure, he carried himself
extremely well, and, with his fine classical head, perpetuated
the tradition of the Kembles.</p>

<p class='c016'>Ray Rockman was one of our Argonaut friends, and became
a very intimate friend indeed. She stayed with us at Salcombe
and elsewhere, besides being constantly at our house.
With her tall, slight, aristocratic figure, the face of a marquise
of Louis XV’s court, and her wonderful Oriental eyes, she
had the presence of the greatest <i>tragédiennes</i> who have adorned
our stage. When you see her in a drawing-room, you think
instinctively of Sarah Bernhardt’s great parts, and rightly,
because she was Sarah’s understudy in them in Paris before
she came to England. If any actor-manager had wanted
a leading lady for tragedy, she would have been one of the
most famous actresses on our stage to-day, for she had the
divine fire. But London does not run to tragedies, except
for the glorification of an actor- or actress-manager, so she
had to descend to being the villainess of melodramas generally
finishing up with suicide in the last act. In the <i>Great Ruby</i>
she showed her real dramatic power. But she has never had
the chance of becoming the leading lady at one of our chief
theatres like His Majesty’s, where she could have taken
London by storm with her magnificent presence and carriage
and the passion she can put into her acting with her marvellous
Oriental eyes and coal-black hair. These she owes to her
being a South Russian. I am not sure whether she was born
in Russia or the United States, where her father is a doctor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>in Montana—a friend of the Copper King. If any one were
to make a play out of Sarah Siddons, Ray Rockman would
be the ideal actress to cast for the leading part.</p>

<p class='c016'>It was Ray who introduced me to the wonderful Annie
Russell, the most temperamental of American actresses. I
say American, though she was born in Liverpool, because
practically all her work has been done on the other side, and
it was Ray who introduced me to Sarah Bernhardt. Unfortunately,
Sarah does not like talking English, and I am
not equal to saying anything very interesting in French,
though I read it with facility, and know plenty of “kitchen”
French for use at hotels and railway-stations. Sarah sent
me seats to see her in <i>Hamlet</i>, which she pronounced “omelette.”
I found it rather wearisome, to be quite honest,
because I hear French so badly, and when I went down to see
Ray and her in her dressing-room at the end of the first act, I
gladly accepted her invitation to spend the rest of the evening
in her dressing-room, “if I could not follow her easily.”</p>

<p class='c016'>It was extremely interesting to watch her dressing, and
she did not take any more notice of my presence than if I
had been a fly, while she was actually being got ready for
the stage, though she made herself extremely pleasant during
the acts when she was off the stage. She could divest
herself of the personality of Hamlet, and resume it at a
moment’s notice. Ray speaks French as well as English,
so everything was quite simple, with her there to interpret.
During the longest interval a message came down for her
that the Prince of Wales (afterwards King Edward VII) was
in the house, and Sarah went off to see him for a long time;
it seemed like half-an-hour. She invited me to go with Ray
to visit her at that wonderful rock island off the Breton
coast, but for some reason or other I did not make the effort.
I think I had made arrangements to go to St. Andrews.</p>

<p class='c016'>Elizabeth Robins I met at the Idler. One always thought
of her as the actress in those days, and not, as one now thinks
of her, as the novelist. Elizabeth Robins is a tall, spare,
Western woman, with a very eloquent face. She is the
greatest Ibsen actress we have had in England. She had
the unusual courage, for the stage, to think that good looks
and elegance in dress were of no consequence, when she was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>presenting Ibsen’s characters. Her one desire was to fulfil
his conception exactly, and she did it most convincingly.</p>

<p class='c016'>A few people, like myself, knew that she was the “C. E.
Raimond” who wrote <i>George Mandeville’s Husband</i> for that
series of Heinemann’s, but we imagined it to be a passing
phase with her, instead of the prelude to a series of great
novels on burning questions.</p>

<p class='c016'>I do not know who brought Gertrude Kingston to us first,
but she often came. She was the accomplished violinist
mentioned in Lord Roberts’ dispatch of September 13, 1901,
as having rendered special service during the war in South
Africa. Mrs. Silver, for this is her real name, is an authoress
as well as an artist and a collector, as I discovered when we
were going over the old things in Phillimore Lodge together
before the sale.</p>

<p class='c016'>Alice Skipworth was a lovely woman with a gorgeous
voice, whose fortunes on the stage were made in an extraordinary
way. An actor-manager engaged her without any
experience of acting to understudy his wife, who financed
his plays, in an American tour. When they got to Philadelphia,
I think it was, on the second night his wife took
ill, and Mrs. Skipworth duly took her place. Philadelphia
went wild over her beauty and her voice, and the actor-manager
found himself in the unpleasant predicament of
having to decide whether he would close his doors, or persuade
his wife to let Mrs. Skipworth go on taking her place. His
wife, who was, I believe, very charming herself, was a sensible
woman, and thought it would be better to coin money by
doing nothing than to bankrupt herself by acting, so the
understudy acted and sang throughout the tour, and came
back a leading lady in musical comedy. She was a very
clever woman; she could have written an excellent novel
about Bohemian life; she had the knowledge; and she was
both witty and epigrammatic.</p>

<p class='c016'>I need not explain who Murray Carson is. He was a very
great light in those circles, because he was an actor-manager,
and as such had the distinction of giving Lena Ashwell one
of her first chances in <i>Gloriana</i>. In addition to his successes
as an actor and a manager, he was joint author with Louis
Napoleon Parker in that delightful play <i>Rosemary</i>, since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>which he has written many plays. He is quite a well-known
figure at various literary clubs, noted for his remarkable
resemblance to the first Napoleon. The collaboration of
these two Napoleons was, I imagine, a mere coincidence.</p>

<p class='c016'>My last meeting with Decima Moore I am never likely to
forget. She was very fond of watching polo, and we were
sitting together in the pavilion at a club to which I belong,
when a man was thrown from his pony, and dragged along
the ground for several yards on his face, his nose ploughing
a regular furrow till it was broken. I went down to where he
was lying. Every one thought he was killed, because he lay
insensible for so long. When he did come to, he said, “Is
my nose broken, doctor?” The doctor said it was, and then
he said, in my hearing, “Then I hope you will make a better
job of it than God did,” which seemed to me the most extraordinary
piece of <i>sang-froid</i> for a man who, the moment
before, had been almost across the threshold of life and death.</p>

<p class='c016'>Sir Charles Wyndham, whose real name I cannot for the
moment remember, and “Mary Moore,” I have seen chiefly on
the Riviera at Cimiez. I make it the excuse for my forgetfulness
that he forgot what he was forgetting once, when,
coming up cordially to shake hands with me, he said, “I
remember your name quite well, but I can’t recall your face.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Wyndham fought in the war between North and South
in the United States, and he was a member of the company of
John Wilkes Booth, the actor, at the time that the latter
assassinated President Lincoln in the theatre; I have never
heard if he was actually on the stage at the time. He was
brought up, I understood, as a doctor.</p>

<p class='c016'>As an instance of Wyndham’s lapses of memory, I may
quote that one day at Ranelagh he asked me if I was a
member of the Club. I said “Yes.” “Can I telephone from
here?” “Oh, yes.”</p>

<p class='c016'>When we got to the telephone, he began turning up the
name of his man of business, who had a name, which I will
not mention, as ordinary as Skinner; there might have been
a couple of score of the name in the telephone book. He
read down the list. “I can’t remember his initials,” he said.
I looked at him as if to say, “Don’t you often see him?”
He caught my eye. His actor’s intuition told him my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>thoughts. “I know what you’re thinking,” he said. “Yes,
I do ’phone to him every day, but I can’t for the life of me
tell which of all this lot he is.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Irving once told me at lunch a story which he probably
told many others. He was touring in the United States,
and staying either at St. Louis or Cincinnati. One morning
at breakfast a large rat ran across the room. As he had
been up till past five that morning, being entertained by the
local Savage Club—I forget its name—he was feeling rather
cheap, and gave a little start. “You needn’t mind him,
Mis’ Irving,” said the negro waiter; “he’s a real one.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The Trees I have known for a long time. It is an undiluted
pleasure to meet Tree out at lunch—like all actors, he affects
lunches more than dinners. There are few men so witty.
When most of the great actors and actresses were exhausting
their powers of polished vituperation on the unhappy Clement
Scott for his generalisations upon the morals of the stage,
Tree’s reply as to what he thought of the matter was, that
nothing Clement Scott had said made him think any less of
him, and Lady Tree’s rejoinder to the late W. T. Stead is
historical.</p>

<p class='c016'>Cyril Maude always gives me his smile when we meet at a
certain polo club, and often “passes the time of day” to
me very pleasantly. But I know that he is another of the
people who remember your name, when they meet you, but
cannot recall your face. Still, I forgive him for the sake of
that Major in <i>The Second in Command</i>. His charming wife,
Winifred Emery, whose triumph I saw the night she won
her place in the first rank as Marguerite in Irving’s <i>Faust</i>—she
was the understudy—always remembers my face as well as my
name. There never was an actress on our stage who showed
more spirit, unless it is Lena Ashwell turning on a bully, for
Lena turns to bay like the lion “on that famed Picard field.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The Maudes’ daughter is now rapidly coming to the front. I
saw her as one of Portia’s ladies in the <i>Merchant of Venice</i> looking
(intentionally, I suppose) for all the world like the exquisite
Tornabuoni heiress in the choir frescoes of Santa Maria Novella
at Florence, and could hardly believe that it was the same
merry, everyday girl that I meet at the Adrian Ross’s.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>SIR HERBERT BEERBOHM-TREE<br /><i>From the drawing by Yoshio Markino</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c016'>Edward Terry I first met at the Savage, where he was one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>of the most influential members, and afterwards at Barnes,
where he had a dear old house near the church, which has
been improved away to make room for a sweet-shop and a
garage and an auctioneer’s lair. Though he was so capable
in the chair, and such an excellent comedian, I don’t remember
his ever saying anything worth remembering when we
walked or “bussed” down Castelnau together.</p>

<p class='c016'>Penley I never met in private life; I only met him at
the Savage, where he never would do a turn, and where his
dignity—not assumed—when he was in the chair was as funny
as <i>Charley’s Aunt</i>, and proceedings were conducted in the
voice of the curate in <i>The Private Secretary</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>I first met Mrs.—and Mr.—Patrick Campbell at a party
at Oswald Crawfurd’s in the very early ’nineties. She had
been enjoying triumphs in the provinces for some years, but
London was for the first time being thrilled by that marvellously
seductive voice, that languorous grace, and that
panther-like personality, which is sleek till it springs. Of
all actresses, Mrs. Campbell is most closely connected with
Kensington, for she was born in the Forest House, Kensington
Gardens, and lives no farther off than Kensington Square,
where she occupies one of the old houses on the west side.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>The Second Mrs. Tanqueray</i> at one end of her career in
London, and <i>Bella-Donna</i> at the other, established the fact
that for parts in which the infidelity of a wife brings in
passion and intrigue of tragic proportions, she has few equals on
the stage of any country. It is the Italian side of her nature
coming out—her mother was a Miss Romanini. Indeed, one
can picture her at her very finest in an Italian mediæval play—such
as the scene where his beautiful mother mourns over
the body of the terrible young Griffonetto Baglioni.</p>

<p class='c016'>Like Lena Ashwell and Julia Neilson, Mrs. Campbell (Mrs.
George Cornwallis West) might have expected to make her
name by music.</p>

<p class='c016'>She supplies one more illustration of the siren voice of Africa,
which never ceases to call to those who have once listened to
it. For Patrick Campbell made his work in Africa, and died
there in the Boer War, and now their daughter Stella, who had
made her mark on the stage with her <i>Princess Clementina</i> in
Mason’s play, has married and gone to live at Nairobi.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXVIII<br /> <br /><span class='c022'>MY ARTIST FRIENDS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>My</span> first connection with artists came through my cousin,
David Wilkie Wynfield, who was the nephew and godson of
the great Sir David Wilkie. He was a popular artist in both
senses of the word, for engravers used to multiply his pictures
like “The New Curate,” and there was no more popular
figure at the Arts’ Club or in the homes of his brother artists.
A repartee of his was the origin of the picture in <i>Punch</i>, where
a painter who wants to know why he does not get into the
Royal Academy is told that he should not wear such thick
boots. He and some brother artists, of whom I think Marcus
Stone and G. A. Storey are the only survivors, took Ann
Boleyn’s castle of Hever (when, if not abandoned to the owls
and bats, it had not yet become the home of the Astors), as
a summer sketching-box, and I have a picture of them grouped
round the entrance arch, which he painted.</p>

<p class='c016'>So that he might have a better opportunity of introducing
me to all his friends, he put me up for “The Arts,” of which
I remained a member till his death. In those days it was
located in a delightful old house in Hanover Square, which
had belonged to and been frescoed by Angelica Kauffmann.
There I made the acquaintance of the most famous artists
of the day, both painters and sculptors, for your artist, unlike
your author, loves to go to the club at night to relieve his
mind after his long day’s work, by playing pool or demolishing
the claims of his rivals to be considered artists in long technical
conversations through clouds of smoke. The art of blowing
smoke-rings is a speciality of artists. I have heard a famous
R.A. recommend a young painter, who was complaining
that <i>he</i> could never get his pictures into the Royal Academy,
to paint small grey pictures. “Why?” asked the disappointed
aspirant. “Because they are the pictures which Leighton
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>needs to show off his own pictures properly, and he always
picks them out first.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Another time, at the committee meeting when Herbert
Schmaltz was up for election, the chairman asked, “Does
anybody know anything about Mr. Schmaltz?” and the
most popular landscape painter of the day replied, “Mr.
Schmaltz is a man who has taken the illustration of the Bible
into his own hands.”</p>

<p class='c016'>It was Wynfield who introduced me to Joe Jopling. There
have been few at-homes more popular than Mrs. Jopling-Rowe’s.
Jopling, who was a great rifle-shot—he won the
Queen’s Prize at Wimbledon—as well as a regular exhibitor
in the Academy, died a few years after I came to know them,
and his widow married George Rowe. Mrs. Jopling-Rowe,
who is a popular and admirable portrait-painter, and a
constant exhibitor at all the principal picture-shows, like the
Academy and the Salon, when first I knew her lived at Beaufort
Street, Chelsea, but an epidemic of burglars drove her
from there to Pembroke Road, Earl’s Court, and from thence
to an old house in Pembroke Gardens. It made no difference
to her at-homes, which have always been crowded with really
distinguished people, for she has known all the leading artists,
most of the leading authors and actors, and not a few of the
leading public men and women of her time. Millais painted
her portrait in her youthful prime, and if one sees her standing
near it, where it hangs in her house, one notices how little
she has altered in those intervening years, which have been
so full of painting triumphs and brilliant society.</p>

<p class='c016'>Many artists used to come to Addison Mansions. West
Kensington is not like St. John’s Wood or Chelsea; there
was no West Kensington Arts’ Club, and artists had not
many meeting-places except Phil May’s studio and our flat.
Solomon, already nearing his zenith, used often to come
with his brother Albert, and so did Arthur Hacker, though
they both lived some way off. We were asked to Solomon’s
wedding—we and Henry Arthur Jones, I think, were the only
Gentiles present at this splendid ceremony, carried out with
all the historical rites. Albert Solomon very good-naturedly
sat with us to tell us the significance of everything. It was
as interesting as an Easter service in a Sicilian cathedral.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>It was easier for J. J. Shannon, for he lived quite close,
in Holland Park Road, in an old farmhouse, which he gradually
transformed into a charming mansion, where one used to
meet most interesting people.</p>

<p class='c016'>David Murray, the famous landscape painter, was another
frequent visitor among the Academicians, very popular for
his wit and camaraderie, very ready to help any one who
needed a push in high quarters.</p>

<p class='c016'>He has altered surprisingly little—only last summer I met
him at a ball at Sir St. Clair Thompson’s, the eminent throat
specialist’s, whom I knew as far back as 1886 when he was
honorary secretary of the Club at Florence. David was
dancing as much as most of the young men, and not looking
perceptibly older than when I met him a quarter of a century
ago. He is another of the intellectual artists who read
deeply, and he is much interested in Japan. He very good-naturedly
came to advise me about my pictures when I was
selling the contents of Phillimore Lodge, but we had already
parted with the celebrated Nattier of Louis XV dressed as
Hercules—a Burke heirloom—my father sold that to Colnaghi
for £1500.</p>

<p class='c016'>Alfred Drury, that delightfully poetical sculptor, was another
Academician who came often. Drury has a beautiful voice.</p>

<p class='c016'>It was only in our last days at Addison Mansions, after
we had given up those large evening at-homes, that William
Nicholson, not an Academician, but one of the greatest artists
of them all, came. Nicholson was not only one of the finest
painters of the day in inspiration and technique, but was the
pioneer of a new movement, being the first painter to have an
artificial reproduction of daylight installed in his studio—a
costly and highly scientific combination of various lights.
By means of this painting is rendered independent of the
weather and the time. He has painted all night before now.
Mark Barr, a scientific friend of ours, who devised the
apparatus for this, the most brilliant man I ever met, brought
him.</p>

<p class='c016'>Another pioneer of art who used to come to Addison
Mansions often, when he had a studio in Brook Green, was
Francis Bate, the moving spirit of the New English Art Club.
His influence on art has been profound. The new English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>Art Club may have been identified with a certain extravagant
phase by scoffers, but it has embraced men like Sargent
and Shannon, as well as apostles of stiff blue cabbages.</p>

<p class='c016'>The public were quick to appreciate the charm of the soft
grey studies, in which so little was indicated and so much
implied, of Theodore Roussel and Paul Maitland. Maitland,
in spite of his delicate health, was a student as well as a
painter. He was a very clear thinker, like the late Sir Alfred
East, another Academician who often joined our symposia.
I always felt that East could have made his name as easily
in literature as in art.</p>

<p class='c016'>The artist who has played the greatest part in the book life
of his time is, of course, Walter Crane, a really profound
student and thinker, who has held all sorts of most important
directorships in art, and delivered lectures of historical
importance. No artist has such a record in <i>Who’s Who</i>,
for Crane is not only an illustrator of books, but a writer,
and as eminent a socialist as he is an artist. He describes
himself as “mostly self-taught,” but he was apprenticed to
W. J. Linton, and exhibited in the Royal Academy when he
was only sixteen. He lives in ideal surroundings, in a rambling
house, more than two centuries old, in Holland Street,
Kensington. The thing which always struck me more than
the old curios which find such a fitting niche in the house, are
the rubbings of the brasses of his ancestors, for Crane has
a long line of knightly ancestors, one of whom was Chancellor
of England in Stuart times. Of his work I need not speak,
for he has founded one of the schools of modern English Art.</p>

<p class='c016'>When I asked Walter Crane if he had been turned into an
artist by any sensational incident, he said—</p>

<p class='c016'>“My progress—if I may so call it—has been very gradual
and quite unsensational, I think—except to myself. I had
the great advantage of having an artist for a father, and never
remember the time when I did not handle a pencil of some
kind, though it was often a <i>slate</i> pencil. I had no early
struggles to have my wish to be an artist allowed and encouraged,
or any strife about the realisation of that ideal
with a bourgeois-minded family, as one so often hears about
in artists’ histories. I never started for anywhere with half-a-crown
in my pocket—anything of the sort usually quickly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>burnt a hole in what little pocket I may have had—and no
doubt that is the principal reason why I remain poor.</p>

<p class='c016'>“My early fondness for drawing animals caused confident
and friendly critics to say, ‘He will be a second Landseer!’
and nothing could have had a more glowing prospect for me
at the time; but times have a way of changing, and ideals
change with them, especially when one is ‘growing up.’</p>

<p class='c016'>“At the age of sixteen I had what might be called my first
picture accepted at the Royal Academy—first time of asking—but
the subject was ‘The Lady of Shalott,’ and my source
of inspiration was by no means Landseer, but rather the
pre-Raphaelites, and I was already deeply read in Ruskin.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You speak of the ‘paradox of my being a socialist’ in
spite of my descent. Why should it be a paradox for one
who loves beauty and harmony, and strives to realise it in
his work, but who sees around him a world scrambling for
money, glutted with riches at one end of the social scale,
and penniless and destitute at the other, while all the time
the bounty of Nature and the invention and labour of man
provides abundance—but only for those who can exchange
the necessary counters, and for those who hold the keys of
the means of the maintenance of life?</p>

<p class='c016'>“Socialism does not mean lowering the standard of life,
but raising it, and with the abolition of the struggle for mere
bread, and the substitution of co-operation for competition,
it will be possible to build a society founded upon some better
basis than cash, a surplus value. Indeed, it may be said
that a true aristocracy might then become possible, since
personal qualities and character would then have their real
value, purged of the harrowing, selfish burden of private
ownership of the means of life, and estimated by service to
the community.”</p>

<p class='c016'>My most intimate artist friend is Réné de l’Hôpital, who,
in spite of his name and his descent, speaks not a word of
French. De l’Hôpital is one of those happy portrait-painters
who can get a likeness; but he is more than that; if he had
a literary turn, he could write as good a book as any one on
“collecting” economically, for he has a wonderful knowledge
of old furniture and its West-end and East-end values. I
know the extent of his knowledge because he and my brother-in-law,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>the late Frederick Robert Ellis, were my advisers
when I sold the contents of Phillimore Lodge, and the auctioneer
said they fetched half as much again as they were
worth, because we knew their value and their points were so
well brought out. De l’Hôpital owed his knowledge partly to
the fact that he was born in a great old house full of treasures.
Having known what it was to struggle himself, when he became
an artist against the wishes of his family, he does a great deal
for the poor.</p>

<p class='c016'>De l’Hôpital, who is a French count, son of the sixth Duke
de Vitry, has had the honour of painting Prince Arthur of
Connaught and Pope Leo XIII, and was a Gold Staff officer
at the coronation of King George V. He married a daughter
of John Francis Bentley, the great architect who built the
Westminster Cathedral. Mrs. de l’Hôpital has written a book
entitled <i>The Westminster Cathedral and its Architect</i>, and
collaborated with me in one of my books in which she would
not allow her name to appear.</p>

<p class='c016'>Two painters who used to come to Addison Mansions arise
in my mind with East. Both were portrait-painters, recognised
as among the soundest executants of their craft—J. H.
Lorimer and Hugh de Trafford Glazebrook—for both were
interested in literature as well as art—a not common trait
among artists—and both of them paint portraits with enduring
and outstanding merit. Lorimer, as I have said, was the
son of the late Prof. Lorimer of Edinburgh University, the
eminent international jurist who made the restoration of
Kellie Castle his hobby, and brother of Sir Robert Lorimer,
who restored St. Giles’ Cathedral at Edinburgh, and a cousin
of Norma Lorimer, the novelist. Glazebrook was a brother
of Canon Glazebrook, late head master of Clifton, an Oxford
friend of mine who never won the high jump, though he could
clear five feet eleven, because he happened to have for a contemporary
the only man who ever cleared six feet in the
’Varsity sports.</p>

<p class='c016'>A new school of black-and-white artists was coming rapidly
to the fore. Pictorial journalism on an unprecedented scale
had invaded England from America, and a number of new
illustrated papers and magazines had started, and they relied
for their pictorial side on ideas which must have seemed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>revolutionary to those who had been brought up on the old
standard productions of the <i>Illustrated London News</i>. The
foundation of <i>The Graphic</i> a decade or two earlier had been
a sign of the times.</p>

<p class='c016'>The most extraordinary artist of the movement could
hardly be called a journalist proper, because most of his
work was done for books published by John Lane, and for the
<i>Yellow Book</i>. Beardsley, who was a mere boy, with his
boyishness accentuated by his fair hair and consumptive’s
pink-and-white complexion, came nearly every week with a
very pretty sister who made her name rapidly on the stage.
Beardsley, who had a workmanship of spiderish delicacy
and an imagination like Edgar Allan Poe, which resulted
in the creation of female types of appalling wickedness and
snake-like fascination, did not talk much “shop”; he was
more occupied with the studies on which these extraordinary
creations were founded. He was a very interesting man to
talk to, very modest. He always impressed me as a man with
a wonderful future if he were not cut off, as he was, by an
early death.</p>

<p class='c016'>Phil May, another genius of the movement, was one of our
most constant visitors. He lived, as I have said, in a studio
improvised from a stable, almost opposite Shannon, in those
days. He did more than most men to revolutionise black
and white, because he was one of the first who grasped the
value of Japanese effects and introduced them into his work.
But his method of producing these Japanese effects was not
Japanese. A Japanese artist fills the brush, which he uses
as pen and pencil, with Indian ink, and secures his effects
with a few dexterous sweeps. Phil May drew his picture in
the English way with comparatively few lines, then studied
his own work to see what was superfluous, and rubbed out
every superfluity. He was not the rapid worker which one
imagined from his style. After he left the Australian paper
with which he was connected, he remained a free lance for
years, drawing whatever came into his head as irresistible,
and selling it to one or other journal, and bringing out collections
of his drawings of the year in his famous annual. It was,
perhaps, not the best way of making money, but it came very
naturally to him, for he was as brilliant a wit as he was an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>artist. He was a man of inspirations; he could be irresistibly
funny with such simple materials as the henpecked husband.
He was the reverse of henpecked himself. He had a devoted
and very pretty wife, who was forgiving to all the faults
he committed in his bland and childlike way, and I often
used to think that his jokes about henpecked husbands formed
his way of crying “peccavi.” Who that had ever seen it
could forget his picture of the husband coming home at three
o’clock in the morning and being asked, “What do you mean
by coming home at this time of night?” and pleading that
there was nowhere else open? Or his picture of the drunken
lion-tamer, who had taken refuge from his wife in the lion’s
cage, with his wife outside the cage crying “You coward!”</p>

<p class='c016'>I do not think he ever made his speech in the rooms of the
Piscatorial Society the subject of a picture, but it was worth
it. He was the guest of the evening and had dined a little
too well—at any rate, as far as drink was concerned. When
he rose to respond to the toast of his health, he looked round
the room and saw dozens of glass cases stuffed with salmon
and pike of monstrous size, the pride of the Society. He took
them all in with a wave of his hand, and said, “I suppose
you will tell me that there is only one ——y kipper on that
wall!”</p>

<p class='c016'>On another occasion I was with Phil and Corbould at the
Savage Club. We stayed there very late, and when Phil
finally made up his mind to go home, he could not remember
where he lived. Of course, we knew his own studio quite
well, because it was close to our homes, and we had been there
scores of times, but he was not residing there; he was staying
in lodgings, for he had just come back from the Japan fiasco.
He had received a commission from the <i>Graphic</i> to go to
Japan for a year or more, and do sketches for them. They
offered him very liberal terms, and he accepted them. He
let his studio for a year, and started off full of good intentions.
But he never got to Japan. He stopped somewhere on the
way—a very long way from England—and abandoned himself
to a lotus life of mild dissipation—we might, perhaps,
have called him a lotus-drinker—and the <i>Graphic</i> had to
bring him home again. It was soon after he got home that
this event at the Savage happened.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>“Where to?” asked the cabby.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I don’t know,” said Phil. “I have forgotten where I
live; it is not my own house.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, how am I to get you there?” asked the cabby.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I do not know what the name of the house is,” said Phil;
“but I think I could draw it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“There are a good lot of houses in London,” said the cabby,
“and they are mostly all alike.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But there is a church near it,” said Phil; “and I could
draw that.”</p>

<p class='c016'>A menu card and a pencil were procured, and he drew a
picture of the ordinary London house and a rather toyshop
church. The cabby looked at it and said, “I know where it
is; that’s Osnaburgh Terrace,” so Phil got into the cab, and
then the cabby turned round to Corbould and myself and said,
“That’s Phil May, ain’t it?” We said yes, and he unbuttoned
his coat and put the menu card carefully in his pocket,
remarking, “It will be worth something some day.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The extraordinary thing was that any one who was so
witty and such a consummate artist should have been ignored
by <i>Punch</i> for so many years, though he became in the end one
of its most honoured contributors. The editor approached
him in a very curious way when he felt that he could not ignore
him any longer. He did it through the firm who at that time
reproduced illustrations for <i>Punch</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>Phil May was one of the best-hearted of men, generous to a
fault, alike with his money and in his attitude to his rivals.</p>

<p class='c016'>Very famous people used to come sometimes to those
ultra-Bohemian gatherings in his studio, including some of
the Queens of the music-hall stage.</p>

<p class='c016'>It was Phil May, I believe, who drew the inimitable cartoon
in the <i>St. Stephen’s Review</i> of Mr. Gladstone, with a malevolent
eye, gathering primroses on the banks of the Thames
on the anniversary of his illustrious rival’s death, which had
for its title—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A primrose by the river’s brim,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>A yellow primrose was to him,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And it was nothing more.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c025'>The cartoon was received with universal acclaim, but the
general public—<i>quorum pars fui</i>—did not bother as to who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>the artist was. I did not know Phil at the time. He was
just back from Australia, where he had been working for the
<i>Sydney Bulletin</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>Phil May had the head of a mediæval jester, and was fond
of drawing himself in the cap and bells.</p>

<p class='c016'>Another black-and-white humorist of a different type who
was with us just as much was Dudley Hardy, whose satirical
sketches of ballet girls and their admirers filled the periodicals
of the day, obscuring Dudley Hardy’s claim as an artist.
He was a son of the well-known marine painter, T. B. Hardy,
and was lured from doing the really admirable work with which
his friends are familiar, by the fatal popularity of his theatrical
caricatures. It was long before he could make up his mind
to break away from that and do himself justice in painting.
His sister married a very great friend of ours, a water-colour
painter of extraordinary cleverness and charm, Frank
Richards. We have many of his pictures, mostly impressionist
water-colours, which prove the heights to which Richards
could have risen if he had continued to have the leisure to
which he was born. He might have done very well in black-and-white
too. He could have come nearer to Phil May than
most people, for he too had caught the spirit of Japan in
the simplicity and bold curves of his drawing; and he had
considerable humour. His limpidity and the charm of his
colouring were especially shown in his paintings of Venice.</p>

<p class='c016'>His portrait of Dudley Hardy is simply admirable, for
Dudley, with his whimsical smile and jaunty way of wearing
his hat, looks like a Parisian notable.</p>

<p class='c016'>For some years we saw more of Reginald Cleaver than any
other artist. Cleaver was at that time the favourite artist
of the <i>Graphic</i>, as well as a regular contributor to <i>Punch</i>.
He was excellent in catching likenesses, and his crisp and
beautiful handiwork made his pictures of passing events most
attractive. The <i>Graphic</i> always sent him to the most important
functions, such as royal weddings. He hated this work,
because he was far too gentlemanly and too shy to push,
and the people in charge of royal functions seemed to take
a pleasure in putting every disadvantage they could in the
way of the artists and journalists who had to immortalise
the occasion for their fellow-countrymen. The artist was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>expected to stand behind the organ or anywhere else provided
he was sufficiently out of sight; whether he could see or not
was of very little consideration. But one day Fate overtook
the autocrat who used to browbeat the Press. It was in
the days when the late King was Prince of Wales, and his
brother, the Duke of Edinburgh, had just become a German
reigning prince as Prince of Saxo-Coburg Gotha. Cleaver,
who was posted where he could not see the procession as it
entered, imagined that the Duchess of Edinburgh as a reigning
princess would take precedence of the Princess of Wales,
and gave her precedence in his picture in the <i>Daily Graphic</i>.
Before ten o’clock the next morning a messenger from Marlborough
House arrived at the <i>Graphic</i> office to know the meaning
of this libel, and the editor explained that the artist had
been placed in a position where he could not see the Princess.
The Princess was furious. She attached no blame to the
artist, but she sent for the autocrat and gave him to understand
that there must be no more accidents of this kind,
and from that day forward there was a great change in the
way in which artists were treated at royal functions.</p>

<p class='c016'>We spent several of our summer holidays together.
Cleaver’s sketches of famous people at historical functions
will have a permanent value. He had no rival in fidelity and
charm in this kind of work. In recent years the world has
seen too little of his work owing to his being so much abroad.
He is the elder brother of Ralph Cleaver, the well-known
political caricaturist.</p>

<p class='c016'>Holland Tringham, a very good-looking and well-bred
man, of whom I saw a good deal at that time, had a battle
royal with a millionaire duchess over a similar question. He
went down to represent one of the chief illustrated papers at
a great ball she was giving at her country house. When he
got there, he was received with scant ceremony, but began his
work. When supper-time came, the housekeeper arrived to
tell him that he would find his supper in the still room. He
showed her the beginnings of his sketch—and he was a brilliant
artist—and said, “Take this to her Grace and tell her that
if she does not come and fetch me to supper with her guests,
I shall tear it up, and go home.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>Her Grace came, took him to supper, and introduced him
to her friends galore, and the picture appeared. Of course,
Tringham was very sure of his position as an artist with the
paper, or he would not have risked the chance of being sacrificed
on the altar of the offended duchess. I should like to
have heard what the housekeeper told her.</p>

<p class='c016'>There has not been so much of this snobbery lately among
hostesses; the race for publicity having become too acute.</p>

<p class='c016'>I must have met Sambourne, who succeeded Sir John
Tenniel as chief artist of <i>Punch</i>, when I was a boy, for he
married a Miss Herapath, and when we were children she
and her brothers were generally having tea at our house in
Upper Phillimore Gardens if we were not having tea at theirs
a few yards away. I never lost sight of him, and in the last
years of his life saw more rather than less of Sambourne,
whose thoroughness was always a marvel to me. No pains
were too great for him to be accurate in the details of his
cartoons and whimsicalities. I forget how many thousand
photographs he told me he had, which he could use like a
dictionary. But I remember that his idea of the best day’s
holiday one could take was to go to Boulogne in the morning
on a day when there was a good sea on, lunch there, and come
back in the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c016'>His successor on <i>Punch</i>, Bernard Partridge, was very often
at Addison Mansions in the old Idler and Vagabond days.
He had already achieved fame in two directions—as a black-and-white
artist whose handiwork was unexcelled for delicate
beauty and romantic charm, and as an actor. But he did
not act under his own name; he was Bernard Gould behind
the footlights. Partridge’s father, the late Prof. Richard
Partridge, was a Fellow of the Royal Society and one of the
greatest surgeons of his day. Mrs. Partridge, then Miss
Harvey, was also often at our at-homes.</p>

<p class='c016'>Another <i>Punch</i> and <i>Graphic</i> artist often with us was
Alexander Stuart Boyd, whose wife, Mary Stuart Boyd, is a
favourite novelist of the great house of Blackwood. Boyd
has the dry wit of his race, so it is not surprising that such a
fine artist should have found his way to <i>Punch</i>. He now
gives his time to painting and spends much of his time at a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>house he has in the Balearic Islands. He was a very old
Vagabond. I met him there or at the Idler teas.</p>

<p class='c016'>There, too, I met Hal Hurst, my neighbour and constant
associate for years, though we do not often meet now. I
have various pictures of his in my present house. Hurst,
who was a very clever artist, and his friend Alyn Williams,
the president of one of the two Miniature Painters’ Societies,
not only shared a studio in Mayfair, but married beautiful
young wives about the same time, who were constantly
together, one very dark and the other very fair. Mrs.
Williams was the picture of health, but suddenly she was struck
down by a mysterious malady, and almost wasted to death,
a terrible shock to all who had seen much of them. Then,
for no apparently sufficient reason, she suddenly picked up
again, threw off her malady completely, and was restored
to her old radiant health; it was like coming back from
the grave. The Royal Family have been great patrons of
Williams’ miniatures.</p>

<p class='c016'>Oddly enough, I knew the president of the other society
of miniature painters equally well—Alfred Praga, an Italian
by extraction, a well-known and popular member of the
Savage Club. Praga lives in a picturesque grey house off
Hornton Street. His wife is a well-known writer.</p>

<p class='c016'>With them it is natural to mention the brilliant Robert
Sauber, a German by extraction, who for years was one of
the most popular artists in journalism; whatever paper or
magazine you took up, it was almost sure to have a cover
with a charming female figure designed by Sauber. I have
a delightful specimen painted for the menu of the Vagabond
Club on some important occasion. But Sauber was not
only a journalistic artist; he has been painting large decorative
panels and ceilings and portraits for the last thirteen
years, and has done no illustrations for the last twelve years.
He is an exhibitor at the principal Salons in London, Paris
and Munich.</p>

<p class='c016'>While mentioning <i>Punch</i> artists, I forgot two who were
constant visitors at Addison Mansions—John Hassall and
Chantrey Corbould.</p>

<p class='c016'>The man who helped to keep our at-homes going more than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>any one else was Chantrey Corbould, the artist, a godson of
the great Sir Francis Chantrey, whose bequest is almost as
famous as his sculpture; he was a nephew also of Charles
Keene, the immortal <i>Punch</i> artist and etcher, on the mother’s
side. Edward H. Corbould, his father’s eldest brother, taught
the Royal Family.</p>

<p class='c016'>Corbould was a huge man, with a very jovial, high-coloured,
handsome face, and a very horsey appearance,
as becomes one of the best hunting-picture artists who ever
drew for <i>Punch</i>. He had a very loud and hearty laugh, which
could be heard all over the house, and told good stories,
and always had a court of the ladies of Bohemia round him
in the inner room. He had one golden quality; whenever
he saw a woman sitting neglected, he went over and fetched
her to join his circle, and the older and uglier she was, the
more particular he was to do it.</p>

<p class='c016'>I was wrong in saying that we never had an entertainment
at our at-homes—Corbould’s stories were an entertainment,
but people had not to keep silent with them; the more noise
they made, the better he liked it. He was very funny sometimes.</p>

<p class='c016'>When I asked Corbould what first turned his attention to
Art, he said—</p>

<p class='c016'>“I was always for the Arts. Charles S. Keene, my
mother’s brother, took me in hand, saying ‘sketch from
Nature,’ so I am altogether self-taught. I never went to
any Art school. Keene’s idea was that I should eventually
step into a ‘staff appointment on <i>Punch</i>.’ I began under
Shirley Brooks, then Tom Taylor, and later under F. C.
Burnand. Tom Taylor promised me the first vacancy at
‘The <i>Punch</i> Table,’ but he died, and F. C. Burnand took on
Furniss. I began with <i>Punch</i> in the early ’seventies; later
I worked for the <i>Graphic</i>, the <i>Illustrated London News</i>, the
<i>Daily Graphic</i> (1890), etc. I have always loved ‘gee-gees.’”</p>

<p class='c016'>John Hassall is a universally popular man, and certainly one
of the most capable artists of the day. One cannot be sure
to what heights he will rise. He was not much more than a
boy when he first came to our house, and he was not much
more than a boy when he first got into <i>Punch</i>. As he is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>brilliant caricaturist, with a strong political sense, he could
be the Conservative F.C.G. whenever he chooses. Probably
he would dislike the drudgery of producing constant political
cartoons—all work done against time. G. R. H., the famous
cartoonist of the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, found the work too exacting,
and Hassall, the most popular poster designer of the
day, has many irons in the fire which require attending to.
But he is a born caricaturist of the unexaggerating kind
which the future will demand.</p>

<p class='c016'>Joseph Pennell, the artist, and his charming wife, one of
the best travel-writers in America, have been friends of ours
for many years. They live in an old house in Buckingham
Street, Strand, near the gate, which now does nothing on
the Thames Embankment but is, I suppose, the last of the
water-gates of the Thames. Pennell conferred one of the
great pleasures of our lives on us by making us go to Le Puy,
at the source of the Loire, which he had been drawing for
some periodical. The statues of saints and tiny chapels
standing up on needle rocks against the sky, which look so
fascinating in his sketches, are not a whit less fantastic in
real life, and, until quite lately, you could see from the plain
High Mass being celebrated in the cathedral, which was at
the western end of the rock. The great west doors were flung
open for the purpose, until the mortality among the priests
became too great. At Le Puy the old market-women wear
their hats over their caps, and frogs are as cheap as dirt—real
edible frogs.</p>

<p class='c016'>I went to a banquet given by the town to its most famous
son, M. Dupuy, who was then Prime Minister of France,
and was, as it happened, a native, though he did spell the
Puy in his name with a small p. We paid three francs a head—less
than half-a-crown—for the banquet, including wine,
and an introduction to the Premier.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
